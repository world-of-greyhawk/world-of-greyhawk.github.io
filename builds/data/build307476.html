A battalion of purple dragon troops entered the city of Alacast, with silver and green dragons flying above in an arrowhead formation. Scanning the city with troops on their backs the dragons acted as search and rescue teams, to find survivors of the Great War.<br><br>The Dark Lords “Hellfire” spell had burned other cities to the ground in one casting and killed so many that even the resurrected Lord of Murder Baal, was disgusted at the action and sent his Blood Army to the mortal realm.<br><br>The Blood Army commander, did not sit back and watch his allies search for survivors, instead the monstrous Orc was usually found within the ranks of search and rescue personal, trying to find anyone that could have survived the devastating magical assault. <br><br>Today was no exception, and when he bellowed for clerics to assist him, the veteran clerics rushed to his side. <br><br>“Save this man or get 100 lashes of the whip by sundown. This man MUST survive at all costs….is this clear?” The giant Orc turned to stride away but was stopped by a young cleric new to her apprenticeship.<br><br>“My lord, you call for powerful forces to aide this man, forces reserved usually for our own troops……what troubles you my lord Krall, please speak of it.”<br><br>The elder cleric’s feared for the life of their student and attempted to quiet her with a stern look. The huge Orc turned to the young woman and spoke with such fury the elder clerics trembled with fear….<br><br>“If it was anyone but you questioning my orders Misty, I would give you the hundred lashes myself. Since it is you, know this truth…that man is my blood sworn brother and only human to have ever served in Baal’s Blood Army.”<br><br>White as a sheet, Misty replied “It shall be done my lord Krall”<br><br>The small sun elf woman lifted the flail to the giant Orc and averted her eyes.<br>His hand brushed against hers and he whispered “these fools get the Lash; you will get 1 thousand gold for recovery of this weapon.”<br><br>“My lord, this is a simple weapon of no value. I have no right to receive gold.”<br>“It looks simple my dear little one but it has hidden power. This Blood Flail was forged by my masters own hand”<br><br>The giant Orc strode away, leaving the elder clerics fearing the lash and one tiny sun elf apprentice cleric, speechless.<br><br>Night was ushered in with sounds of clerics being lashed and the blood curdling cries of a sorrowful Blood Orc, howling for his lost blood brother.<br>A simple weapon, would mark the fates of all those that crossed its path………<br><br><br><br>-------------------&gt; Continue Below &lt;--------------------<br><br><br><br>Similar builds in the search engine:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "201395", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Raging Skald (Barb 22 / Bard 8 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Cinnabar Din<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "210982", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Mighty and Terrifying and Thundering Gnomish Barbarian (Barb 28 / Bard 2 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- FinneousPJ<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "218720", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Fireblooded Rager (Barb 24 / Bard 6 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Jennalee<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "206200", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Musclehead (Barb 28 / Bard 2 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- jjellison<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "230819", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Axe Thrower (Barb 29 / Bard 1 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- jockeb<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "230926", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Axe Thrower V2 (Barb 28 / Bard 2 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- jockeb<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "122170", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Beast of War (Barb 29 / Bard 1 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Mongoose22<br><br><br><br><br><b><i> ****************************** </i></b><br><br><br><br><br><b><i>BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA -

I did not include possible buffs and/or a range of magical items due to the choices of many players.<br>Many may not use the magical items and spells I would.<br><br>But what I have done in testing...is buff up with numerous potions and items to become even more insane and unstoppable.....Just to see what it could do.<br><br>(spell)Greater stoneskin,potion of eagle splendor, potion of greater bulls strength,greater cats grace,aid,Bless....etc.....<br><br>Party members which I have tanked for, didnt get why I used so many potions and spells,care of my UMD.

Ok, So before I get into the build itself I'ld like to say  few things about the layout of your post.<br><br>1. Keep skill usage per level out of the leveling guide it causes a lot of clutter, I had a hard time reading through it, I'm sure others will as well. If you want to include lvl by lvl skill usage put it in a separate part of the post<br><br>2. Class/Racial bonuses such as Uncanny Dodge, Keen Senses, Dark Vision, Damage Reduction etc can be kept out of the leveling guide as well, again it causes a lot of clutter and in most cases people will know bout the class/racial bonuses or just won't care.<br><br>3. For the final skill point distribution try to get the base skills then if you want modified skills example being: 43 (54) discipline 30 (31) tumble etc.

I'll tidy up the build a little later today, it seem to contain everything at least, it's just a bit hard to read.<br><br>Don't worry, I'll do a bckup copy first, so nothing accidentally gets deleted.

That is a nice build.  I do have one question, and it may have been deleted in the editing, but you list Heavy armor in the AC section, but, the last i remember, bard barbarian nor rdd can wear it without the Armor Prof: Heavy feat.   <br><br>Pther than that, its nicely done.

Good work, Kail, saved me some trouble. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>For the build.

I like the build. I like Barbarians. I cant get myself to play the RDD class though, just a personal thing. <br><br>Anyways, just a couple of things to consider. 1. Why not more Barbarian levels (and less RDD levels) pre-epic to help raise your BAB? 2. (*This is an option to those that play on servers that ban Dev Crit*): You could exchange 2 STR points for 2 CON points, drop the Dev Crit line of feats, and select the EDR 1-3 feats. That would give you a decent DR. Just an option.<br><br>Good build Sword.

My comments: <br><br>Thundering Rage ain't worth a feat (unless it's for style points) and even less so Epic Toughness.<br><br>Dumping skillpoints in Tumble x-class is not a smart move. Use the bard lvls for tumble dumps.<br><br>Dev Crit can and must be acquired much earlier. It is a signature feat you qualify for early in your career, why postponing it so much?<br><br>Cha and Wis can be left at 8. You'll free up 4 ability points to increase Int (skillpoints) and/or Dex (AC). BTW, as pointed out, you are spending 31 points, you need Str 16, Con 16 to fix it with minimum changes in the build. I'll actually edit this change in.<br><br>Blind Fight should be taken earlier and IPA is questionable in usefulness. I'd skip it and get myself KD and possibly IKD instead of Toughness.<br><br>The build would benefit from Terrifying Rage, which should be acquired early enough (27th lvl for example).<br><br>I'd promptly move RDD 9-10 to epic (lvls 21-211) to gain +1 AB and Bard 1 at lvl 7-8 (depending on the CHA score) for the tumble and UMD dump.<br><br>More lore than what qualifies for RDD ain't necessary. If you decide to go for Terrifying Rage, then Intimidate is a must (and possibly ESF: Intimidate too) and hence a higher INT is necessary. Also, I question the usefulness of a half ranked Concentration.<br><br>Finally, as said, Heavy Armor, ain't an option for your build.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Mat,thanx for the feedback, its my first and like you guys saw, its messy as hell.<br><br>My thanks to Grimnir and Kail for making sense of that mess. At the time I posted that mess, I was runnng on empty and wouldve killed for a coffee so I could see straight.....<br><br>....My youngest gave us a long hard, busy day and my partner thought i was gonna pass out with exhaustion.<br><br>With the original level 1 build, I had self configured the stats myself instead of letting the game roll them for me.The full 10 levels of RDD add hit die increases and plus 2 to all attributes.<br><br>But I will be going back to my level one copy and making sure I got that start up right. Blunt is supposed to be an all strength machine.<br>_________________<br>Surviving 3 cats, 2 kids and a wife deserves some serious game time, dont cha think ?

BTW, I just rechecked everything and you end up having a free general feat at lvl 39... in your original lvl guide you had more CON increases than necessary to end at 20 which ended up freeing up a feat slot.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Avado good buddy, nice to see you.<br><br>Not every builder will follow a recipie he or she has seen.If you decided to try this in battle, you might dump one feat you dont like, and take heavy amour.<br><br>I included the option and data on heavy amour, in case you guys asked for it.And well, I can be abit anal about my notes.....Im not happy unless I get all the choices.<br><br>My active level 40 copy of this guy recieved Heavy amour feat free with a body item, that was specifically designed by a dm to give barbs the full range of choices.<br><br>With an unbuffed naked carry weight of 1700 pounds, weight of heavy amour doesnt even get noticed.<br><br>Imagine what insanity this build could get up to, in a world where crafting includes--&gt;being able to remove the spell failure rates on a full amoured machine like this.<br><br>It could be like a steroid enhanced,ultra destructive version of the magical marauder.<br>_________________<br>Surviving 3 cats, 2 kids and a wife deserves some serious game time, dont cha think ?

Eh, I noticed you cheated yourself short of 21 skillpoints (with the current lvl distribution and stats allocation) and of almost 100 HPs. It is now fixed.<br><br>The build's good, how can one not like a Barb/RDD? You have some minor tweaks to do (tumble bought as x-class with bard in the build is just too much for me eyes... ah, it burrrrns <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) as I and others have suggested, but the base is solid.

I've noticed you mention arcane spell failure frequently, honestly spell failure doesn't seem to matter much with 2 bard levels, you won't be casting anything in combat so taking off armor/shield shouldn't be that big an issue for mage armor or anything else you'ld use from the lvl 1 spell line.

It should also be noted if you want to dump spellcasting, you can drop wis/cha to 8, raise int to 14 you'ld gain some much needed skill points and the option to switch races to Dwarf/Half Orc for +2str or +2 con without losing skill points.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 03/22/09 22:09</span></i></p>

Overall I'm not really certain what happened, there was no action scene, or at least I couldn't distinguish any events.<br><br>Alright, here's the thing, you list a whole lot of useless information I don't want to read, so I'll try to explain the point of naked stats.<br><br>You make a long description of your stats and how they would be if you wear certain armor or certain shield or certain weapon. It's absolutely useless. If you tell me what's your AB with your focused weapon (I can calculate it myself, but doing that is actually annoying, that's why it's a requirement in the posting rules), I can calculate your AB on every circumstance, because whenever I use your build, I won't be using your weapons, so, the unenhanced weapon is all it takes. Also, for comparison purposes, it's also useless to equip a weapon, say, if I want to say "my build has a higher AB than yours", I need to compare stats without weapons (but not without buffs, those are innate to the build), that's the fair comparison, that way there's no need to assume one gets a better enhancement. Same goes for the armor, give me your naked AC and I'll know your AC no matter what you're wearing, so there's no need to make the armor list. And why such an extensive armor list? just use the combination that yields the best AC, as said before, you're ways from being a caster, so forget about casting failure.<br><br>Normally, stating you've got UMD is all one needs to say because it's a pain to list all the crap one can use with UMD. Potions can be used by anyone, that fact that use can use them doesn't makes the build design stronger, everybody can use them too, so it's not an advantage and it's not necesary to list them, it makes no difference.<br><br>Ok, now back to the build.<br><br>You say "Blunt is supposed to be an all strength machine" yet I see no Great Strength feat taken, so I guess it was a lie?

IMO, 400+ base health is perfectly fine for a melee that can expect to hit mid 60s low 70s AC in a +5 setting, 500+ for the 59 or lower AC ranges should be suitable in most situations, if health is such an issue however..there's always con buffs or con gear, so unless you're going for EDR I never find much value in raising con past char creation (Unless you're going for a HP Behemoth of course)<br><br>Either way, if you're going for a str machine go for a str machine not a 1/2 str 1/2 con hybrid, it's not worth it especially since you're not getting something like EDR out of it in the end.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 03/23/09 01:04</span></i></p>

My stance on HPs: I try to get 400+ HPs with my "versatile" characters and 500+ with dedicated meleers and I can accept something between 300 and 400 for my mages. <br><br>In this case, with almost 700 HPS, you could have easily skipped the CON increases and even started with a lower CON score (like 14) and concentrated more on STR, which means killing things faster both because of higher AB (more hits, more crits), higher dmg bonus and because of a higher Dev Crit DC.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

I will be spending the next few days, possibly a week going over my stuff.....<br><br>Being a house husband and father is a full time job.<br><br>Not to mention the three cats, who are very attentive to peoples needs and regularly annoy me at the computer, so i take breaks or else i would go on a 2 or 3 day building/playing bender.<br><br>I may even rewrite the build story and get Grimnir or Kail to cut and paste it over the original......<br><br>Something more focused and violent, more fitting the build i have. Oh yeah,I have a unfinished 300 page book under my bed catching dust......<br><br>Youll likely see more stories with any future builds, that ive taken from my own crazed penmanship.<br>_________________<br>Surviving 3 cats, 2 kids and a wife deserves some serious game time, dont cha think ?
