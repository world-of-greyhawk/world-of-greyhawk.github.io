I was just thinking about making a build that focuses on this spell. Not because I knew that I would come across a 58 str and 81 con dragon! I got me thinking though. <br><br>What items do merge when you cast this spell?<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

Same as usual shapeshift if I'm correct, you merge armor, shield and helmet.

Oh well, details.<br><br>Dragon shift feat can get you up to a buffed STR score of 60, but heck nothing will ever give you 81 CON. I don't use shapeshift, ever, so I'm not sure how much weaker is that dragon, a sure thing is: it is much much weaker than the dragon shape feat, but in real terms it's not 100% crap, still, not of much use, you'll always deal more damage casting by the level you need to be to get that spell.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/02/07 19:13</span></i></p>
