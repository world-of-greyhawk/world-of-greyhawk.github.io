This isn't quite the Chaos Harbinger, but it's pretty close.  It is, however, a Dex-based version, so it might not be quite what you're looking for, although Dex-based builds have the advantage of not having their best feat (Epic Dodge) disabled on most PWs, whereas Str-based builds do (Dev. Crit).  <br><br>Also notice that with the Dex-based version you're significantly better with traps, and you have better Reflex saves, so you're much less likely to take damage from things like Fireballs and Chain Lightnings than you would be with a Str-based build (although of course the Str build would only take half damage with Improved Evasion).  <br><br>Rogue 17/Fighter 8/Cleric 15<br>(Rogue 3/Fighter 4/Cleric 13 pre-epic)<br><br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Domains: War and Trickery<br><br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10 <br>Dex 16<br>Con 16<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 14<br>Cha 6<br><br>+4 Wis, +6 Dex<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 26<br>Con 16<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 18<br>Cha 6<br><br><br>1 Two-Weapon Fighting<br>3 Weapon Finesse, Ambidexterity *<br>6 Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Knockdown *<br>9 Extend Spell<br>12 Improved Crit: Shortsword<br>15 Blind-Fight <br>18 Toughness, Weapon Spec *<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 Epic Weapon Spec * <br>24 Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>27 Great Dex I  <br>30 Great Dex II<br>32 Improved Evasion **<br>33 Great Dex III<br>35 Crippling Strike (or Skill Mastery) **<br>36 Great Dex IV <br>38 Defensive Roll ** <br>39 Epic Dodge<br>40 Epic Prowess *<br> <br>* Fighter bonus feat<br>** Rogue bonus feat <br><br>AB: <br><br>25 base<br>+8 Dex <br>+1 WF <br>+2 EWF<br>+1 Epic Prowess<br>-2 Dual-Wield<br>_______<br>35 AB w/ mundane Shortswords<br><br>+5 Divine Power<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>+2 Battletide<br>+2 Aura of Vitality<br>+1-2 Cat's Grace<br>_______<br>58-59 AB fully buffed<br><br><br>Equipment:<br><br>Robes, preferably Robes of the Dark Moon<br>Keen Short Swords<br><br><br>Skills:  <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Craft Trap:    38<br>Discipline:    43<br>Healing:       20 <br>Spellcraft:    43<br>Set Traps:     38  <br>Tumble:        40<br>UMD:           27<br><br>Total skill credits: 292<br>  <br><br>A few notes:  <br><br>1) Craft Trap and Set Trap are great skills, but are most useful if you take Skill Mastery.  If you choose to take Crippling Strike, they're not quite as useful, although you could certainly still make use of them.  The only thing you may have trouble with without the Skill Mastery feat would be trying to use Epic traps while in combat (not that you really strictly need Epic traps).  <br><br>2) Although personally I kind of like Dwarves for the boost to Con and the fact that you don't get an XP penalty, you could get a better AB and AC by going Halfling.  <br><br>If you were to drop Con and Int 2 points each at creation, you could start with as much as 18 Dex, which would get you +1 to AB and AC, and of course you would get another +1 to AB and AC from the Small Stature feat.  <br><br>Note that you wouldn't want to dual-wield Shortswords with a Halfling as this would give you a -4 penalty; Daggers would be a better choice.

Thanks for the post!!!<br>But if i am going for a more fighter type what do you think about taking Start stats like this:<br>str 16<br>cons 12<br>wis 14<br>int 10<br>dex 15<br>crh 8<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Astaldagar on 03/11/05 07:01</span></i></p>

Yes, those stats will work if you're going Human.    <br><br>The real issue is that if you're doing a Str-based dual-wielder you're adding 3 feats to the build, which you don't really have all that much room for. <br><br>In order to make room for the 3 new feats (Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity, and Improved 2-Weapon Fighting), you'll need to lose 3 feats: I would recommend Toughness, Improved Knockdown, and Epic Prowess, in that order.  <br><br>The only issue with this is that you have now lost 80 HP, 86 skill credits, and your AB will be down by 3 points when you're dual-wielding (1 point lost because of Epic Prowess, the other 2 because you're dual-wielding).  <br><br>Generally speaking, I wouldn't really recommend dual-wielding with a Str-based build, as I think you tend to have a stronger build if you stick to a 2-hander.  That said, if you really want to dual-wield with this build, I would probably change the levels to something like Rogue 13/Fighter 12/Cleric 15.  <br><br>This will give you a couple extra feats to work with, and you have the added bonus of not getting an XP penalty, provided you keep your Fighter and Rogue levels within 1 level of each other.   <br><br>I would recommend something like this:<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 16 <br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Int 10<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>+1 Dex, +1 Str, +2 Wis, +5 Str, +1 Wis<br>(take stat increases in this order)<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 26<br>Dex 15<br>Con 14<br>Int 10 <br>Wis 18<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave<br>3 Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Two-Weapon Fighting *<br>6 Extend Spell<br>9 Ambidexterity, Great Cleave *<br>12 Improved Crit: Shortsword<br>15 Knockdown <br>18 ITWF, Weapon Spec *<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus<br>24 Great Str I, Epic Weapon Spec * <br>27 Great Str II <br>28 Blind-Fight *<br>30 Great Str III<br>31 Improved Evasion **<br>33 Overwhelming Critical    <br>36 Great Str IV, Epic Prowess * <br>37 Crippling Strike ** <br>39 Toughness, Devastating Critical * <br><br><br>With this build, you still lose 86 skill credits, and 3d6 sneak attacks as well, but you don't lose any HP, and your AB is only 2 points lower than the Harbinger of Chaos.
