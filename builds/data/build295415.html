This a pretty solid assassin build, Mick.  Great AC, great dualwielding AB, high Death Attack DC, wicked skill set, HiPS, Keen senses, and so on.  Nicely done.

I forgot the part about wanting to be more of an Assassin right from the get-go. I wouldnt take the 10th level of Assassin pre-epic either. 9/9/2 is the way to go. I guess it would just be a personal preference if one wants Evasion earlier than the Improved Invisibility.
