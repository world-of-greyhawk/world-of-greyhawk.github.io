Prolly something like a bard, PM, BlackG? <br><br>Would be a cool defensive build for Pvp... <br>  ...   ..   ..    ..   ..    ..  .. ..    .  .. ...           <br>Lockindal <br><br>Joined: 14 Jul 2002<br>From: North Canton, OH.<br> Profile: Friday, 30 July 2004 08:49AM<br> <br>BlackG doesn't work well...<br><br>but if your server allows alignment changes, Paladin 20 / Bard 4 / Pale Master 16 is friggin nuts.

I've got a BG/PM character up there that I'm pretty happy with (Undead Fencer V2). Perhaps that's what you're looking for? <br>   ....   ....   ....    ....   ....    ....    ....           <br>Emrill <br><br>Joined: 28 Jun 2002 Profile: Saturday, 31 July 2004 06:10PM <br><br>My 'bad to the bone' character is fairly good. It's more defensive than the undead fencer, but it works very well. I am in the process of tweaking it some to get rid of the epic fiend, and some other minor things, but nothing major. <br><br>One other thing, is you won't get immune to sneak attacks as a palemaster, even though you are imune to criticals.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/01/04 01:22</span></i></p>
