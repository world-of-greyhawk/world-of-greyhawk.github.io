Could someone please describe the path I need to take once I log into NWN to find the Novice to Epic training mod?<br><br>All I have seen are folks responding with a direct link... which does not work on my machine (for some reason).<br><br>If someone could explain it to me from after the point I have logged into "Multiplayer" at the main menu, that would be most appreciated.

What you need to do; is download the module from the link provided.  <br>The links again:<br>CEP Edition: <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1081713915000.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>Non-CEP Edition: <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>1) It is usually a zip or rar file, uncompress this using your favourite decompression tool (I use winrar, which works for zip and rar: <a href="http://www.rarlab.com" target="_blank">http://www.rarlab.com</a> )<br>2) You place the module that is decompressed in your modules directory (so if your nwn is installed in the default location on the c: drive; this would be c:\NeverwinderNights/NWN/modules).<br>3) You then load up neverwinternights and select the NEW button when the game starts.  You should see a list of installed NWN official campaigns (and if you have the latest patch you should see -ugh- a premium button as well).  <br>4) Click on the last button, labelled 'Other'.  The next screen will include (provided you have copied the module to the right place) a link for the novice to epic module.<br>5) There you have it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> .  The same process will work for the single-player modules also available on the vault.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 12/30/04 09:41</span></i></p>
