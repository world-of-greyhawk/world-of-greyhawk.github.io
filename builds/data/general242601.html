I have been playing around with building a Monk 22 / Fighter 5 / Weapon Master 13. My goal was to create a Weapon Fighting Monk, however.... for every build and with every combination I have tried, the monks fists are always way better than any waepon. Even Kama as weapon of choice etc etc. <br><br>Ethically and morally I have an issue with D&amp;D version of the Monk. I have been practicing SHAOLIN KUNG FU for almost 20 years now. The Fighting style of the Monk should mastery of 108 weapons... at least.<br><br>Can anyone effectively build a Monk / Weapon Master in which the weapon works as well as or better than the fists? and make them an effective Epic Character?<br>_________________<br>Ginosifu: King of Kung Fu

Yes, take less Monk levels (10 tops) and more WM levels. Also, I'd recommend you take FTR to 6.<br>_________________<br>"...<br>C'est un pays plus nu que la terre polaire<br>— Ni bêtes, ni ruisseaux, ni verdure, ni bois!<br><br>Or il n'est pas d'horreur au monde qui surpasse<br>La froide cruauté de ce soleil de glace<br>Et cette immense nuit semblable au vieux Chaos;<br>..."

If you're going to take WM, take at bare minimum 16 levels.  19 or 22 is better.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Also,<br><br>If you go strenght-based with a 2-handed weapon, it gets very efficient.  I played a Nagamaki (scythe) wielding Monk/Fighter/WM for a long time and it worked very well.<br><br><br>Drallimer

I hear your frustration with the MONK!  As a MAist for over 20 years (man I feel old <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  ), i had an idea bout a year ago for making an Internal martial artist, specializing in empty hands, using the Divine feats in place of CHI, as bioware doesnt account for this, and chi is spiritual!!.  <br><br>There is one alternative to the suggestions here, yet it involves using the PRC hak.  The class is called Man at Arms.  I have yet to use it, but It seems to be VERY much what you require.  What I mean is, to just qualify for the class you need 4 weapon focused weapons, and If i recall, they have to be different damage types!  <br><br>If you get the urge to download that pak it may be what you need!  LOL  though it is outside of the "official" nwn game.<br><br>Peace

I have a dual-wielding monk 23/fighter 4/wm 13, who works <i>very</i> well, although mine is Dexterity based, not Strength. <br><br>Granted, her attacks don't do a lot of damage, and for the first 1-3 levels she is nigh unplayable, but her bonuses more then make up for it. Buffed AB of +53/+50/+47/+44/+41/+38/+53/+53 for the main hand (haste and f.o.b), +53/+50 in the off hand, <b>76 AC</b> (buffed), SR 33, and has all the other perks a monk of her level would normally have.
