Looks like the race used was dwarf... should put that in the post.<br><br>The spelling is at least readable, it's the information about final stats that I'd like to see.  Dual kama WM has been done to death - there are 13 other builds with this class combination, many that are WM heavy like this one (one with the exact level split).  Without knowing how the stats turn out it's hard to compare or suggest changes.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

This build being the closest one to what I had in store to what I would make as an Evil Little Blender, as I like to call them, I have a couple of changes so I’ll post up the entirety of all the levels every step off the way for two reasons one I have a word document I have saved that is outlined so I just have to plug in a few things then cut and paste and two it looks a lot cleaner and makes a little more sense then to right out every place I change levels being I break up where I take levels in a lot of places in comparison. The build has many of the same faults low AC and low saves but it gives a few more feat as well as adds a couple of points to hit which could make or break any fight when your talking about dev crit hit accutually landing on a high AC build.<br><br><b>Little Blender – Fighter (12), Monk (6), Weapon Master (23)</b><br><i>Dwarf, any Lawful of course I make it evil for the title of Evil Little Blender<br>PvM/PvP build CR 37 ECL 39</i><br><br><b>ABILITIES</b> <i>(Ending)</i><br>STR: 16 (32)<br>DEX: 16<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 10<br>INT:  14<br>CHA: 6<br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hitpoints: 469<br>Skillpoints: 184<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 22/18/25<br>BAB: 29<br>AB: 49/44/39/34/29/24<br>AB with Furry of Blows and off hand weapon: 45/45/30/35/30/25/20 45/40<br>AC (naked/mundane full plate): 24/27<br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Discipline 43(54)<br>Intimidate 4(2)<br>Listen 43(43)<br>Parry 43(46)<br>Tumble 43(46)<br><br>Remaining Points 4<br><br><b>Ability points:</b><br><br>Strength drops all the way <br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>Character Level- Class (Class level): Feats<br>01: Fighter(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>02: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>03: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Kama, Dodge<br>04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR 17)<br>05: Fighter(4): Expertise<br>06: Fighter(5): Toughness<br>07: Fighter(6): Mobility<br>08: Fighter(7): STR+1, (STR 18)<br>09: Fighter(8): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>10: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Kama<br>11: Weapon Master(2)<br>12: Weapon Master(3): STR+1, Power Attack, (STR 19)<br>13: Weapon Master(4)<br>14: Weapon Master(5)<br>15: Weapon Master(6): Great Cleave<br>16: Weapon Master(7): STR+1, (STR 20)<br>17: Weapon Master(8)<br>18: Weapon Master(9): Improved Critical: Kama<br>19: Weapon Master(10)<br>20: Fighter(9): STR+1, (STR 21)<br><i>(epic)</i><br>21: Monk(2): Blind Fight, {Deflect Arrows}<br>22: Monk(3)<br>23: Monk(4)<br>24: Weapon Master(11): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR 23)<br>25: Weapon Master(12)<br>26: Weapon Master(13): Overwhelming Critical: Kama<br>27: Weapon Master(14): Great Strength II, (STR 24)<br>28: Weapon Master(15): STR+1, (STR 25)<br>29: Weapon Master(16): Devastating Critical: Kama<br>30: Weapon Master(17): Great Strength III, (STR 26)<br>31: Weapon Master(18)<br>32: Weapon Master(19): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR 27)<br>33: Weapon Master(20): Great Strength IV, (STR 28)<br>34: Weapon Master(21)<br>35: Weapon Master(22): Armor Skin<br>36: Fighter(10): STR+1, Great Strength V, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, (STR 30)<br>37: Fighter(11)<br>38: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>39: Monk(5): Great Strength VI, (STR 31)<br>40: Monk(6): STR+1, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}, (STR 32)<br><br>Foot notes:<br>Your critical range is as most weapon masters know is rather small for Kamas but you make up for it in numbers and if that isn’t enough to wet you appetite to go with this think about some of the times having to deal with pale masters, undead, or golems that aren’t affected by critical hit you still deal great numerous hits and can knockdown your opponent and sit on top of them beating them to a bloody mess or scrap iron incase of golems.<br><br>Threat Ranges from 17-20/x3 or if you found a holy grail of fighters Keen weapons 16-20/x3 which is about 20% chance of threat of critical and with haste 2 attacks out of the 10 attacks in one round threat for crit. at a DC of 41
