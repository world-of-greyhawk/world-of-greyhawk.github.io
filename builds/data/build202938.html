<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br>...<i>A bit difficult to play from level 1 - 6</i><br><br>Hello. This is my first character to be posted on these boards. I don't know whether this character is smoothly playable from 1 to 40, but i know that he shoudn't have any alignment conflicts, but he will need to strugle till level 6.<br><br>My first idea was to make a character with the highest Implosion spell DC. Then i desired to min and max him and thought to take monk to benefir from his high Wisdom. Then i decided to use a ranged weapon to benefit from Zen Archery and high Wisdom again. And later, the guy who likes Cinnamon Buns and whos name is awfuly alike the name of the bun, suggested to take some Cot levels instead of Cleric, because Cot gets Greater Wisdom as a bonus feat.<br><br>I have improved this character several times now and the results hve been wonderful. I have added more hp, more bab and 1 extra feat tho this character by improving it.<br><br>Human/ Lawful Neutral/Good<br>STR 10<br>DEX 14<br>CON 12<br>WIS 18<br>INT 10<br>CHA 8<br><br>Everything goes to Wisdom!<br>Trickery and War Domain<br><br>Level 1 || Monk 1 ||- Point Blank Shot; Rapid Shot<br>Level 2 || Monk 1/Cleric 1 ||-<br>Level 3 || Monk 1/Cleric 2 ||- Toughness<br>Level 4 || Monk 1/Cleric 3 ||-<br>Level 5 || Monk 1/Cleric 4 ||-<br>Level 6 || Monk 1/Cleric 5 ||- Zen Archery<br>Level 7 || Monk 1/Cleric 6 ||-<br>Level 8 || Monk 1/Cleric 7 ||-<br>Level 9 || Monk 1/Cleric 8 ||- Weapon Focus: Kama<br>Level 10 || Monk 1/Cleric 9 ||-<br>Level 11 || Monk 1/Cleric 10 ||-<br>Level 12 || Monk 1/Cleric 10/Cot 1 ||- Called Shot<br>Level 13 || Monk 1/Cleric 10/Cot 2 ||- Wpn Fcs: Longbow<br>Level 14 || Monk 1/Cleric 11/Cot 2 ||-<br>Level 15 || Monk 1/Cleric 12/Cot 2 ||- Spl Fcs: Evocation<br>Level 16 || Monk 1/Cleric 13/Cot 2 ||- <br>Level 17 || Monk 2/Cleric 13/Cot 2 ||-<br>Level 18 || Monk 2/Cleric 14/Cot 2 ||- Grtr spl Fcs: Evoc.<br>Level 19 || Monk 2/Cleric 15/Cot 2 ||-<br>Level 20 || Monk 2/Cleric 16/Cot 2 ||-<br>Level 21 || Monk 2/Cleric 17/Cot 2 ||- Epic spl Fcs: Evoc.<br>Level 22 || Monk 2/Cleric 18/Cot 2 ||-<br>Level 23 || Monk 2/Cleric 19/Cot 2 ||-<br>Level 24 || Monk 2/Cleric 20/Cot 2 ||- Armor Skin<br>Level 25 || Monk 2/Cleric 20/Cot 3 ||-<br>Level 26 || Monk 2/Cleric 20/Cot 4 ||- Grt WIS I<br>Level 27 || Monk 3/Cleric 20/Cot 4 ||-Epic Wpn Fcs: LngBow<br>Level 28 || Monk 3/Cleric 20/Cot 5 ||-<br>Level 29 || Monk 3/Cleric 20/Cot 6 ||- Grt WIS II<br>Level 30 || Monk 3/Cleric 20/Cot 7 ||- Grt WIS III<br>Level 31 || Monk 3/Cleric 20/Cot 8 ||- Grt WIS IV<br>Level 32 || Monk 3/Cleric 20/Cot 9 ||-<br>Level 33 || Monk 3/Cleric 20/Cot 10 ||- Grt WIS V; VI<br>Level 34 || Monk 3/Cleric 21/Cot 10 ||-<br>Level 35 || Monk 3/Cleric 22/Cot 10 ||-<br>Level 36 || Monk 3/Cleric 23/Cot 10 ||- Grt WIS VII; VIII<br>Level 37 || Monk 4/Cleric 23/Cot 10 ||-<br>Level 38 || Monk 4/Cleric 24/Cot 10 ||-<br>Level 39 || Monk 4/Cleric 25/Cot 10 ||-Grt WIS IX<br>Level 40 || Monk 4/Cleric 26/Cot 10 ||- Grt WIS X<br><br><br>End Stats:<br>STR 10<br>DEX 14<br>CON 12<br>WIS 38<br>INT 10<br>CHA 8<br><br>I focused on 3 skills: 40 Tumble, 40 Spellcraft and 43 Concertration.

I love the idea of this character... it could really work in my PW. One thing- the Kama WP is not very necessary... I'd drop it... in place for... Extra Turning or something... second, Trickery domain? Is it expandable... if it is I'd say take the Plant domain... Barskin and Creeping Doom gotta love it. I really love this build and I AM going to build it from scratch in my PW... I'll tell you in about 4 hours how the first 7 lvls go. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Well, you could probably choose a different weapon, but why not the one weapon that Monks can use that will keep the Monk's attack schedule?<br><br>Trickery domain gives you the invisibility line of spells.

I love the idea of using cot to increase the wisdom.  I did it on one of my posted builds.  <br><br>I am wondering though, if this build really needs the 4 monk lvls?  If you took 29cleric/10cot/1monk at lv 40 you'd get most of the benefits monk gives, but have better cleric spells?

At first i created this build for myself. My idea was to make it platable from a lover level. Use level 1 monk for more skill points and make me able to use monk gear from lower levels. The monk gear is usually good. It gives boosts to DEX and WIS and it has AC on boots and all other stuff. I find monk gear to be quite good from time to time. And Im sure your Wis will be higher and higher with every item and level you get and it would be fun to level up and see that you got 27 extra AC : P. But hey, it can be done. You'd lose some speed, 4 skillpoints, abit balance in your AC progression, but you'd gain 1 extra cleric bonus feat. You could take extended spells or anything you wish.<br><br>Now, the War domain is quite importand, because it adds a very powerful abilty to this character. And its advised to cast the Charisma increasing spell on yourself to make it last longer. At the moment it lasts 4-5 rounds. It could last 6 rounds. Get some charisma items and it lasts longer.<br><br>The second domain is your choise. I choose Trickery for Improved Invisibility- 50% concealment out of nowhere! But you can choose travel for haste or animal if you want your life to be easyer at lower levels. Get a level 5 or 7 animal at level 1 to protect you. But its up to you.

Also. I forgot to tell, that this character can be a real nobleman or a rich man in lower magic worlds. Even with an unbeliveable rest restrictions. It only doesn't work if the spell Continual Flame is nerfed. Alright. Here is how it works. Buy alot of plain old daggers. Prepear as many continual flames as you have and then sell them to the merchant. To attract less attention and to make it seem normal, then buy every armor and weapon from the shop and cast it on them and sell all of them to some other shops. This makes it seem that the shop sells items with light property. Even if there are rest restrictions, you can always rest in the tarven. Buy a room and cast/rest/cast as long as you want. You will have enought money. if you feel that this is exploiting or doesn't feel right, then don't use this. But this is an option!<br><br><br>This character can be very fun. When you first glance at him, he doesn't posses much muscle nor isn't he the fastest lad in the party nor very dexterious. He can't even properly lead a party nor convince anyone. But yet he can rise hell!

I would try 6 levels of Monk, there's so much going on at that level (KD, IKD)...  But other than that, great build.

At first, Cinnabar Din suggested 24 cleric, 10 cot, 6 monk. But i realized, that what would with Knockdown with a bow? The only thing i see useful from 6 monk, would be another 10% speed increasment and some extra skillpoints. But you would lose 2 ac OR 2 ab. Its up to you!
