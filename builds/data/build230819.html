Nice build! But I think Halfling has a lot more to offer than Elf. If you go Halfling, your AB with your throwing axes will bump by 1 (they get +1 to hit with any thrown weapon), get +1AB and +1AC due to size, and your CON will be 2 points higher. This means you'll be able to drop toughness and keep the same HP, and replace it by EWF to raise your AB by another +2. All that at the cost of -1Dmg! And you also get the "lucky" feat. So, in short, going halfling gives you:<br><br>+4AB<br>+1AC<br>+1 all saves<br>-1Dmg<br><br>I think it's a pretty fair trade, no?

LOL You beat me too it!   Agreed.  Go halfling.  In fact, the ONLY way elf wins over halfling would be IF you needed wizard, and since it isnt an option for rdd, go pintsize!  I love the idea.  THanks for posting it.<br><br>Peace

What's the reason for Barbarian instead of Fighter. You get the same xp-penalty (except if you go Human), your damage will benefit from EWS, you will have more feats to improve combat stats.

So I changed race to halfling. This made some differances, but none that are too big.<br>Changes:<br>HPs +40<br>AC = the same when naked, but you can't use tower shield, so you lose 1 AC there<br>AB +1<br>Fort +2<br>Will +1<br>So this build is better with halfling.

Valid point about uncanny dodge. Halflings have +1 AB and AC from size, which makes it another point better than Elf. Your sheet doesn't show it, but see the combat log. And why not 2 bard levels? 1 to finish. Don't put skillpoints in both spot and listen unless you max them, as they are now both is mostly useless. Finishing with Bard you have the opportunity to top off a number of skills and Discipline, Tumble and spellcraft is among them. Barbarian 29 gives you nothing anyhow.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
