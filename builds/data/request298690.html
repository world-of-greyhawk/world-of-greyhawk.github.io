Best AB build melee is a Halfling FTR/HS/WM, DEX-based finesse build. I think the split is something along the lines of FTR 11/HS 1/WM 28. <br><br>Actually, there may be a dragon build that gets something higher.<br><br>Best ranged AB build is an arcane archer.<br><br>Highest AC build was posted a long while back by cdaulepp. Something like CLC/Bard/PM with improved Expertise. It got up to 137 or more AC (can't recall the exact number) with +20 gear.<br><br>High AC and HPs: likely going to be a Bard/PM based build, using either Gnome or Dwarf. Probably BBN for the third class, and pumping CON.<br><br>Assassin/Thief master: not sure what you mean by the death blow fusion comment. Are you looking for a high Death Attack DC or just the most sneak dice you can get? If the latter, go with Rogue 39/Assassin 1 or Rogue 29/Assassin 11 if you want the Assassin's spell-like abilities. Take all 10 Improved Sneak Attack feats. Final sneak dice tally is 41d6.<br><br>Max number of attacks is anything with 16+ BAB, Haste, and Monk levels that exploits the Monk's attack schedule and uses Flurry of Blows.<br><br>Ultimate build: you've got to define 'ultimate'. One person's preference in that category is going to be far different from another's.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  screw you, there's no point in this. If I make a build there has to be a purpose.

My perfect builds are Druid / Monk and Cleric / Monk / Dwarven Defender because they're highly playable good casters + meleers, but you might not like them, and they're far from invincible.

@Cinnabar Din a few things the assassin/theive thing is that it has max sneak attacks and a decent dc for death blow also what is a BBN i havent played in so long i forget all the abbreviations for stuff and the utimate build was just cause i remember someone saying there was this one bidl he or she had and it was godly they called it the ultimate build i think it had cleric/and some kind of prc classes thing could buff itself so much i could probably 1 hit kill most things thanks for the advise though im going to search for those one you mentioned i was looking up the ac build my self and say they wouldnt be very playable at all just waking wall<br><br>@Thaxll'ssyllia(other then the fact that your name is rediculasly hard to spell) nice to see you to and i realy just am trying to find something that can be a more or less god charecter for personaly perpises<br> <br>now to all ill be a bt more specific <br>builds one i think is covered enless someone finds a better one thats a dragon<br>build 2- ill look up on search for the best AA so thats covered im thinkig rouge/bard(or wizard)/AA or somehting like that<br>build 3 forget<br>build 4 forget<br>build 5 if someone could find a specific rouge(and/or)assassin/X<br>that does serious damage (str-based?)(dual weilder if possible)(through mostly sneaks) that can also go toe to toe with crit. immune enemys (undead,constructs ect.) also if you drop rouge (perfered)or assassin for shadow dancers HiPS thats fine as well as long as it keeps at least most of the sneaks (13+)<br>build 6 if someone could make a monk/cleric/(if possibly WM if not fighter) that can cast haste that woud be good and for <br>the last just if someone could find a build that can just blow a hole through just about anything and still take a punch<br><br>and by the way thax (there i abbreiated your name) I LIKE MAKING REDICULOUS CHALLENGES LIKE THIS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By haseo terror of death on 07/10/08 19:13</span></i></p>

As to your Assassin/Rogue, if you want a high Death Attack DC, then go with much more Assassin levels. Something like Rogue 13/Assassin 27 will get you the same 41d6 sneak attack 9assuming you take all 10 Imp SA feats), and you can still get Epic Dodge if you're going DEX based. The Death Attack DC will be 37 + INT modifier for that build.<br><br>If you want to go STR based and still dual wield, you can do so. Keep the same split or go Rogue 11/Assassin 29 for 2 more DC on the Death Attack.<br><br>Slipping SD in there is no big deal either. Rogue 13/SD 1/Assassin 26 loses you 1d6 sneak, but otherwise is the same.<br><br>Ideally, I think it would be better to take a hit on some of the sneak dice and grab levels of FTR for some feats and a BAB boost to get a full attack routine.<br><br>BBN = Barbarian, btw.<br><br>Thax: no need to abuse the guy. If you don't want to give him any help, then don't but you don't need to be rude to him.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

You start as Lawful Good, take paladin in level 1 or 2 and then start a sadistic massacre or something to become evil, you can't be a Blackguard until around level 11 anyway (you won't get the BAB from a Sorcerer earlier than that, you also require Cleave), so you might be evil by then if your server allows Alignment change.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/09/08 07:26 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>THax, you know i love and respect you, right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

My idea of an ULTIMATE build is a cleric (full caster lvl) with Epic Mage Armor, Epic Warding, Epic Storm Mantle (among other epic spells), with The prc spell Living undeath (castable PM) and dev crit.  I have handeled just about anything that could be thrown at you pvm, solo.   Is there really anything else to ask?
