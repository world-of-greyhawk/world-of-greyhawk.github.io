With an initiative that high, you should always (or almost always) get the first attack. Called Shot: Legs are used to slow your enemy's advance and if he gets too close, cast darkness, enter stealth mode and run away. Epic Dodge and SCII will help get with that. Against spellcasters using Epic Warding it could prove a challenge... Base damage is a low 11-18...<br><br>About feats, you could replace Improved Initiative with Weapon Finesse or Blind-Fight, and then swap Superior Initiative by the one you didn't take or SCI, and then take SCII and III at level 39. I figured a sniper wouldn't really spend time trying to hit someone with a melee weapon, but would rather be trained in dodging and getting away quickly. Your call though.<br><br>As always, comments/suggestions/insults are welcomed <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/30/05 21:58</span></i></p>

Hmmm Hey! That Build name is mine!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I like rogue/wiz/AA builds, to give you a proof, I have another "Arcane Sniper" who happens to be a rogue/wizard/AA <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .<br><br>A few comments:<br>I would go Rogue8/wiz2/AA10 Pre-epic, that would give you 1 extra AB at the cost of nothing (nothing but take 2 more wiz levels post-epic and 2 less AA).<br><br>You have your pre-epic class levels a bit messed jumping from rogue6 to rogue 10.<br><br>I would take less wiz levels, I think 2 is enough, invest into UMD and use scrolls (Make a wizard friend who could scribe scrolls for you;)) or wands. 3 more levels on rogue means 2d6 extra sneak attack and 18 more skillpoints or 1 more rogue level and 2 more AA levels for 1 more damage, 1d6 sneak attack damage, 1 more AB and 14 more skillpoints. Only a thought.<br><br>I bet this build is made for soloing more than my AA builds, mostly because epic dodge and self concealment arent needed for someone who is at the back part of the party.<br><br>About epic dodge, I think it is possible with "only" 13 rogue levels, what would free you 3 rogue levels (If you take your 13th rogue level at 37 you still have 3 levels to take epic dodge as a regular feat or perhaps a bonus AA one while maxing your skills.<br><br>In short, you could make a Rogue13/Wizard2/AA25 with Epic dodge (and perhaps self concealment) at the cost of 2d6 sneak attack and a bit (only a bit) of spellcasting (but you still can cast from wands and scrolls via UMD), gaining 4AB, 3Damage per hit, and some HP.<br><br>About combat tactics, I would cast darkness between your enemy and you (not on him), callshot him to slow him down enough to make him spend a lot of time to cross the darkness, and, while he is inside the darkness you will be scoring sneak attacks (always you dont forget casting ultravision <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> ).<br><br> - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br><br>It is only what I would do with the build, everybody knows that building isn't an exact science <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

Seems like I'll have to get myself a new name, uh? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  I'll think about that and change it in due time.<br><br>I wanted to go wiz5 to be able to cast an extended cat's grace, ultravision, darkness and haste so as not to rely so much on scrolls and wands... Sure those lvl3 slots do come late, but I found no other way to max my spellcraft skill. Going rogue8/wiz2/aa10 pre-epic would help with AB and damage, but then again your rogue levels wouldn't be spread out to max tumble along the way. And I'd really lke to have access to my first stat buffs in pre-epic. What you could do is take a rogue level at 12 and 17 instead of  19 and 20, which wouldn't affect the build at all. <br><br>If you can net Epic Dodge with 13 levels of rogue, then I could 22 levels of AA and end up with one bonus AA feat to offset the rogue special feat that I'd lose, and get enchant arrow XI instead of a mere +1d6 sneak. This'd be interesting.<br><br>Note that I build characters I intend to solo-play. I've got something against parties in multiplayer, and in the OC having henchmen is kinda the same as going solo, considering the AI:p<br><br>Thanks for the input! I'll try to come up with a different and better level progression keeping that in my mind!:)
