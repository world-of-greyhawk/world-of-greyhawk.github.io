I play on a PW where mobs have relatively high AB, but relatively low AC.  I wanted to design a build that would have very good full-time ac.  That is, good AC without using limited abilities or spells.  At the same time, I wanted enough damage to beat mobs' regen.  I also hoped to have flexibility to do more damage or take more damage, as the situation warrants.  Thus was born the Dwarven Brick.  Like a brick, he is small, but very solid.  Extremely tough, but with several sharp, pointy corners.  He can be a wall, or he can be a weapon.<br><br>Dwarven Brick<br><b>Playable level 1-40, PvM</b><br>Any Lawful alignment<br><br>Monk(9), Shadowdancer(5), Dwarven Defender(26)<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 16 (28)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 6<br><br>Dwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br><br>01: Monk(1): Dodge, M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>02: Monk(2): M: (Deflect Arrows)<br>03: Monk(3): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Monk(4): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br>05: Monk(5)<br>06: Monk(6): Mobility, M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br>07: Monk(7)<br>08: Monk(8): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>09: Shadowdancer(1): Toughness, SD: (Hide in Plain Sight)<br>10: Shadowdancer(2): SD: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>11: Dwarven Defender(1): DD: (Defensive Stance)<br>12: Dwarven Defender(2): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Kama, DD: (Defensive Awareness I), (DEX=19)<br>13: Dwarven Defender(3)<br>14: Dwarven Defender(4)<br>15: Dwarven Defender(5): Improved Critical: Kama<br>16: Dwarven Defender(6): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>17: Dwarven Defender(7)<br>18: Dwarven Defender(8): Expertise<br>19: Dwarven Defender(9)<br>20: Dwarven Defender(10): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Dwarven Defender(11): Improved Expertise<br>22: Monk(9): M: (Improved Evasion)<br>23: Dwarven Defender(12)<br>24: Dwarven Defender(13): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br>25: Dwarven Defender(14): Armor Skin<br>26: Dwarven Defender(15)<br>27: Shadowdancer(3): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=24)<br>28: Dwarven Defender(16): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Dwarven Defender(17)<br>30: Dwarven Defender(18): Power Attack, Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>31: Dwarven Defender(19)<br>32: Shadowdancer(4): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>33: Dwarven Defender(20): Improved Power Attack<br>34: Dwarven Defender(21)<br>35: Dwarven Defender(22): Epic Prowess<br>36: Dwarven Defender(23): DEX+1, Blind Fight, (DEX=27)<br>37: Shadowdancer(5): SD: (Defensive Roll)<br>38: Dwarven Defender(24)<br>39: Dwarven Defender(25): Epic Dodge<br>40: Dwarven Defender(26): DEX+1, Epic Toughness I, (DEX=28)<br><br>Hitpoints: 524<br>Skillpoints: 216<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/25/31<br>BAB: 27<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 32/32<br><br>Discipline 43(45), Heal 43(45), Hide 10(19), Lore 36(40), Move Silently 8(17), Spellcraft 18(20), Tumble 40(49)<br><br><br>The Brick ends up with 18/- damage reduction, along with a long list of bonus tricks:<br>Monk AC Bonus, Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, Flurry of Blows, Deflect Arrows, Monk Endurance, Still Mind, Purity of Body, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Wholeness of Body, Hide in Plain Sight, Defensive Stance (12/day), Defensive Awareness III, Improved Evasion, Shadow Daze, Summon Shadow, Shadow Evade, Defensive Roll, Uncanny Dodge II<br><br>With the monk attack schedule, along with flurry of blows or Improved Power Attack, he can put out usable damage with a Kama.<br><br>I considered rearranging things to get the additional 9 DR from feats, but I had to sacrifice far too much to get them.<br><br>In a world with +5 items available, he has 68 AC with haste.

Conceptually, it is a good build.  The DD cannot take Tumble except by cross-class, though (according to the grimoire, anyway) and so you'd have to move your last monk feat back to level 37, which may make playability an issue til then.<br><br>I haven't taken the time to count your skill points but your allocation seems high.  DD get 2/level, SDs get 6 per level, and monks get 4/level.  Check that, it's where my builds usually fail.

D'oh!  I did a search, too, to see if there was anything very similar, but I didn't think to look through the recent non-indexed builds.  I normally watch those anyway, but must have missed one.<br><br>It looks like you chose the two-weapon feats essentially in place of power attack and expertise feats.  I thought about that, but PA and Exp are both very helpful on my PW (World of Amon, btw, a great PW imho).
