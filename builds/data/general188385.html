I wonder if we could have a designator in the build description of the builds added.<br><br>I would like to see PvM and PvP as further designators of builds.<br><br>I am not really into PvP servers. I like to PvP every now and then but mainly play on story servers. <br><br>It just makes it far easier to help select a build if PvM or PvP was specified in the description.<br><br>PvM builds do not need some of the things that PvP builds need and some PvP do not need things that are mainly used against mobs.<br><br>The builders intention of use would help alot.<br><br>Just my thoughts.<br><br>-Pendragon
