Wanted to post it here to see what people thought before actually sticking it in the "official" forum, since I'm new at this and not too sure of myself.<br><br>First of all, apologies ahead of time if this class is super-cheese.  I originally thought it up before I even knew this forum existed, although I have tweaked it a bit since then.  Basically, I wanted to make a mainly Monk character with Fighter/WM to flesh out Kama-wielding abilities -- not make a Fighter/WM with Monk just to nab the Kama AB progression.<br><br>Note that this is pretty similar to Mithradates' <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "202161", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Ferocious Man-Chicken of Doom</a> but I hope different enough to warrant posting.<br><br>Anyway, here's what I've got:<br><br><b>The Thresher's Demise</b><br>Monk 21/Fighter 12/Weapon Master 7<br><b>Playable 1-40 PvM, not PvP optimized</b><br>Alignment: Any Lawful<br><br><b>Human</b><br><br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 15<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Monk(1): Dodge, Mobility, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Kama<br>03: Fighter(2): Expertise, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Kama<br>06: Fighter(5): Spring Attack<br>07: Fighter(6): Whirlwind Attack<br>08: Weapon Master(1): STR+1, Weapon of Choice: Kama, (STR=18)<br>09: Weapon Master(2): Ambidexterity<br>10: Weapon Master(3)<br>11: Weapon Master(4)<br>12: Weapon Master(5): STR+1, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, (STR=19)<br>13: Weapon Master(6)<br>14: Weapon Master(7)<br>15: Monk(2): Improved Critical: Kama, {Deflect Arrows}<br>16: Monk(3): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Monk(4)<br>18: Fighter(7): Toughness<br>19: Fighter(8): Blind Fight<br>20: Fighter(9): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Fighter(10): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, Epic Weapon Specialization: Kama<br>22: Fighter(11)<br>23: Fighter(12): Power Attack<br>24: Monk(5): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=22)<br>25: Monk(6): {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br>26: Monk(7)<br>27: Monk(8): Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br>28: Monk(9): STR+1, {Improved Evasion}, (STR=24)<br>29: Monk(10)<br>30: Monk(11): Overwhelming Critical: Kama<br>31: Monk(12)<br>32: Monk(13): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>33: Monk(14): Devastating Critical: Kama<br>34: Monk(15)<br>35: Monk(16)<br>36: Monk(17): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=26)<br>37: Monk(18)<br>38: Monk(19)<br>39: Monk(20): Great Strength II, (STR=27)<br>40: Monk(21): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br>AB w/ Mundane Kama: 42/39/36/33/30/27<br>AB w/ Dual Kamas: Main: 40/37/34/31/28/25 Off: 40/37<br>Damage w/ Dual Kamas: Main: 1-6 +15 (17-20/x3) Off: 1-6 +10 (17-20/3)<br>AC Naked: 26<br>Hit Points: 478<br>Skill points: 263<br><br>Fort: 24<br>Will: 18<br>Reflex: 24<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Mind Effects: +2, Poison: +1<br>Spell Resistance: 31<br><br>Discipline 43(52)<br>Heal 43(42)<br>Intimidate 4(3)<br>Lore 43(45)<br>Persuade 41(40)<br>Spellcraft 21(23)<br>Tumble 43(45)<br><br><b>Notes</b><br>&gt;&gt;This build is mostly intended for single-player, hence the skill selection.

I just figured a few more skillpoints were better than +2 HP, but that's not set in stone.<br>&gt;&gt;In early levels, one will probably want to stick with Heavy Armor.<br>&gt;&gt;Monk levels could be spread around a bit more to keep Tumble topped off.<br>&gt;&gt;If you're not interested in Overwhelming/Devastating Crit. you could take two more Great Strengths, Epic Prowess, and perhaps Epic Will to get a total of +2AB and +4 Will saves.<br><br><b>Advantages (as compared to Ferocious Man-Chicken of Doom)</b><br>&gt;&gt;Gets lots of feats a good deal sooner (Ambi, ITWF, IC, EWF, EWS, WM feats)<br>&gt;&gt;Gets Dev.

Just want to tell you that when you post in the build request forum (where this should have been <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ), it doesn't matter if it's totally, or nearly similar to an earlier build. It's what that forum is there for.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Ah, okay, wasn't sure which forum to put it in because I wasn't sure if it was good/well-polished enough to qualify for the official forum.<br><br>Additionally, and regarding the citing of similar builds, I was hoping to basically submit this build assuming it seemed decent to others, so wanted to get it in good shape to start with.
