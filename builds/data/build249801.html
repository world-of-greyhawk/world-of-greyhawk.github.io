Shooting and Slashing PvM (1-40) and PvP<br><br>HERALDIC HIGHLANDER (War Prince of the Elves)<br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>Human belief in the elves, or supernatural and invisible human-shaped beings, is universal. In Old Norse and Teutonic lore (Germanic, and also Franco-Normans and Anglo-Saxons), elf was associated with magic, fertility, and nature, with some people believing they’d be transformed or reborn elf if they acted honorably. Elf is semi-divine, immortal, and either both fair and beautiful (light elf), or repugnant and mischievously evil (dark elf). Celtic elves – or fairies, as they were later known in Great Britain -- were not “little friend folk” or Pixies, as in the Isles, but the size of actual humans. Ancient writers suggested the legendary Scottish Highlanders, and Burgundies’ royalty (France), were elfin descendant. Old Swedish royalty were also said to have had elfin ancestors, claiming their own descendants to be “more wise and handsome” than any other, as a result of having elf ancestry. The belief in the existence of elf was shared among all Pan Indo-Europeans, including Great Britain (such as in Ireland, where elves include leprechauns, faeries, and Picts (or Pixies, who are lords of the dance), France, Germany, and all Scandinavian nations, where elf lore is profound, and persists into the USA and Canada.   <br><br>In Old Norse, the elves were a major topic of discussion, and upon which JRR Tolkien’s, “Lord of the Rings” was based. According to the Viking Sagas, the world and heaven will come to an end, during a time known as Ragnarok or, the ‘end times’ – as a result of a final war to be waged between the gods and fiery giants. The Sagas speak of a hall, Gimle, which is said to be located at the southernmost end of heaven, in which it is also said a few shall survive when heaven and earth come to pass. Above the hall was said to be another heaven, and above that lay another heaven still, which some believe to be inhabited by the Light Elves; if this is true, then the light elves will survive the Ragnarok, too. It is not clear whether or not this place is actually the same as Alfheim (“home of the elves”); however, that the elves exist, on a world all of their own in the Nordic Universe is a settled matter. Equally the stuff of legends are the Highlanders, as renowned for their heraldic warrior-clan skirmishes and fearless battle honor, as they are for their poetry, song, and all matters concerning romance.<br><br>Character: The Highlander is designed for combat versatility, having both a ranged and combat/melee focus, in keeping within the spirit of the above legend lore. S/he is first, and foremost, a stealth sniper, with high ranged AB and the ability, as an arcane archer to enchant, imbue, and also fire the “arrow of death”; combined with epic longbow specialization, and enjoying up to six (6) attacks per round, this character achieves good ranged damage. S/he is likewise an agile swordsman, being equipped with good combat/melee AB, epic short sword specialization and the ability to dual-wield short-swords (for up to six (6) attacks/round), such that s/he can also dish some decent damage in hand-to-hand combat. <br><br>Other than reflex, saving throws (particularly will save) may at first glance seem problematic; however, this character has stealth skills and UMD, which gives him/her the ability to self-buff stats, and also his/her saving throws, among other things (i.e., hitpoints, AC, AB, and damage). Without further adieu, please meet the Highlander (War Prince of the Elves).<br><br><br><br>The HERALDIC HIGHLANDER (War Prince of the Elves)<br>Fighter(12), Arcane Archer(25), Bard(3)<br><br>Half-Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Low-light Vision, Partial Skill Affinity: Listen, Partial Skill Affinity: Search, Partial Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br><br>Alignment: Any Non-Lawful (Neutral Good, Chaotic Good or Chaotic Neutral Preferred)<br><br>Final Stats: <br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (34)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 418<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 25 (+1 Song)<br>Will: 17 (+1 Song)<br>Reflex: 34<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Mind Effects: +2<br><br>In addition to having UMD, the Highlander’s Prestige Arcane Archer class enables him/her to:<br><br>•	Imbue Arrows, 3x/day (or rest period) can fire a magic arrow at a target, which explodes into a blaze of fire causing 17d6 damage (reflex save for half, as against a naked DC 47) to all enemies in the area of effect, plus piercing damage on target creature;<br>•	Hail of Arrows, 1x/day (or rest period) can fire off a hail of arrows, damaging 25 targets simultaneously;<br>•	Seeker Arrows, 2x/day (or rest period) can fire an arrow that cannot miss its target;<br>•	Arrow of Death, 1x/day (or rest period) can fire arrow that, on hitting its target, forces said target to make a fort save or die.<br><br><br>I.

This is a great class combination, and those AB's are impressive.  War Prince of the Elves, indeed--versatile and quick.  While some may object to Blinding Speed as worthless, I find it to be very useful at times (in low magic environments -- also, there are some PW's that enhance this feat, such as Hall of the Worlds where it gives monk-like speed and +2 attacks above and beyond what haste grants for 90 seconds).<br><br>Very nice build.  You'll want something to shore up those will saves, but mind-immunity gear/potions are some of the easiest to come by, and you've got UMD if you do find something in that regard.  Great work--looks like fun!<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

It's a good build, nothing to add really.  Since you are so much better with your bow than your swords, it seems a bit of a waste to specialize in those weapons.  Still, it's a nice take on a classic.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
