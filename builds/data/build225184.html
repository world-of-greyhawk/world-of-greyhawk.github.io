With Lasting Inspiration Lingering Song makes a minimal difference (100 vs. 105 rounds). I suggest you move Still Spell to Bard3 and move BG3 to level 12.

If you want longer lasting feats on that, take charisma instead of strength.<br>Your ab will suffer though.<br>And besides, almost every server has charisma increasing items.<br>Combine that with Eagle's Splendor and you can easily get a couple rounds more out of it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>And about the lingering,<br>I thought it would be like this<br>(Song 10 + Lingering 5) * Lasting 10 = 150 Rounds<br>Guess I was wrong.<br>But the lingering feat makes it more playable from lvl 1 till lasting.<br><br>Still I would not take Divine Might because of the low uses of "Turn Undead".<br>I'd rather go for Toughness or Blind Fight then. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  But that's a personal choice we all have to make I guess?

However, if you're going to drop Lingering Song, Blind-Fight is not a bad choice at all. Whatever tickles your fancy as a builder, mate.<br><br>As for Lingering Song + Lasting Inspiration, it would indeed make sense if the duration was increased to 150 (at least if Lingering Song was picked first, and why would it no be).

Definitely get Blind Fight.  No melee should ever be without it.<br><br>Divine might/shield... reasonable picks if you're increasing your cha heavily for other reasons (saves, spellcasting, etc).  Not so good if you aren't.  This build sort of straddles that line... I think it's alright to use them where you have room in your feat list.  But I wouldn't bother with them otherwise.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Nice concept overall. Just a few points:<br><br>Maybe take Curse Song at 3rd level instead of Lingering Song at all (as mentioned beforehand).<br><br>Don't bother taking Tumble to 42 - stop at 40 as it caps out there.<br><br>Lore? would this be a worthwhile skill for the jester?<br><br>Your Buffed AC calculation is missing the 20 points from Epic Mage Armor.<br><br>Couple of bits of info missing - Saves and Hit Points<br><br>Tested this out and I get the following: <br><br>Fort 25 <br>Reflex 24<br>Will 24<br>HP 359<br><br>None of which are particularly high, even with the benefits of Bard Song or other buffs.<br><br>I would seriously consider dropping STR at startup to 15 and put 2 into DEX, thereby requiring only a minimum roll on a Cats Grace to get the maximum modifier allowed in Full Plate - adds 1 to AC and 1 to Ref save before buff.<br><br>Also, drop 2 of the Great CHA feats as you only benefit from 1 point to all saves and one 4th level spell.<br>Take something more necessary such as Epic Fort, Will or Reflex perhaps, even a Great Strength to balance out your overall STR back to an even number, if you go the route mentioned above. Perhaps even a ESF: Perform to hit the required 50 ranks to enjoy your 20th level Bard/ Curse Song. Maybe even ESF: Taunt if you pump that instead of UMD - fully buffed this can reach 63 with a full Eagle's Splendour, 20th Bard Song and ESF: Taunt).<br><br>Personally I enjoy the Bard PM build with A. N. Other class involved, the only downside generally is the lowish BAB, HP and Saves when unbuffed. From an rp point of view they can run pretty wild, as I am sure this one no doubt will.<br><br>Either way have fun playing it through. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Oh and seriously reconsider taking a Divine Feat - this really will be a bit of a waste with such a low CHA.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 12/28/05 22:47</span></i></p>
