Frogger70’s build <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "257184", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Thief in the Night</a> inspired me to look further into the Cleric8/Assassin30 level split. Taking Cleric let you cast Darkness more freely. You can both buff dexterity and intelligence, the most critical stats in an Assassin build. Divine power is great (as usual) both to improve your AB when you do your death attack, and as a means to get more than one hit in the first flurry for more chances of paralyzing the victim. Hold Person is a nice spell against characters with low will saves (eg fighters below lvl 20)<br>You have access to all cleric spells up to lvl 4, giving you some flexibility when it comes to facing different in game challenges. I took Strength domain to get Divine power at lvl 3 with the possibility to extend it at lvl 4. I took Animal domain for Cat’s grace and to get True seeing at lvl 3. I guess the “empowered” animals can help you a bit early on and will fit a ranger RP theme, but they are not essential to the build. <br>I did not take Trickery domain because Improved invisibility comes as a lvl 5 spell. With more cleric levels, I would have chosen Trickery and perhaps War domains<br>I have chosen Ranger as third class in this build. It gives dual wield and an off hand attack for free, freeing up pre epic feats and enabling BAB 15 at lvl 20 with 10 lvls of Assassin taken pre epic. <br>The 2 lvls of Ranger won’t give you access to ITWF. But the main point here is to get different means of 4 attacks per round so you get 2 attacks in the first Death Attack flurry:<br>* Dual wield giving 4 attacks against “normal” opponents<br>* Single weapon (melee or ranged) and Divine Power giving 4 attacks with max AB against more difficult opponents<br>* UMD let you cast haste from scrolls, gaining one extra attack at full AB<br><br><b>Night Ranger (Ranger2/Cleric8/Assassin30)</b><br><br>Human, any evil alignment<br>Lvl 1-40 PvM<br>Lvl  15-40 PvP<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 16 (36)<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br><br><b>Levelling guide:</b><br>01 Ranger 1 Luck of Heroes, Weapon Finesse, FE1, (Dual Wield)<br>02 Cleric 1 Strength and Animal domains<br>03 Cleric 2 Blind Fight<br>04 Cleric 3 Dex 17<br>05 Cleric 4<br>06 Cleric 5 Extend spell<br>07 Cleric 6<br>08 Cleric 7 Dex 18<br>09 Ranger 2  Knockdown, (Skilldump: Hide and Move silently)<br>10 Assassin 1<br>11 Assassin 2<br>12 Assassin 3 Point blank shot, Dex 19<br>13 Assassin 4<br>14 Assassin 5<br>15 Assassin 6 Improved Knockdown<br>16 Assassin 7 Dex 20<br>17 Assassin 8<br>18 Assassin 9 Weapon Focus Shortsword<br>19 Assassin 10<br>20 Cleric 8 Dex 21, (Skilldump Spellcraft)<br>21 Assassin 11 Epic Weapon Focus Shortsword<br>22 Assassin 12<br>23 Assassin 13<br>24 Assassin 14 Epic Prowess, Great Dexterity I*, Dex 23<br>25 Assassin 15<br>26 Assassin 16<br>27 Assassin 17 Great Dexterity II<br>28 Assassin 18 Great Dexterity III*, Dex 26<br>29 Assassin 19<br>30 Assassin 20 Great Dexterity IV<br>31 Assassin 21<br>32 Assassin 22 Great Dexterity V*, Dex 29<br>33 Assassin 23 Great Dexterity VI<br>34 Assassin 24 <br>35 Assassin 25<br>36 Assassin 26 Great Dexterity VII, Great Dexterity VIII*, Dex 33<br>37 Assassin 27<br>38 Assassin 28<br>39 Assassin 29 Great Dexterity IX<br>40 Assassin 30 Great Dexterity X*, Dex 36<br><br>* Assassin bonus feat<br><br><b>Skills:</b><br>Hide 43 (56) (60 in wilderness)<br>Move silently 43 (56) (60 in wilderness)<br>Spellcraft 23 (25)<br>Tumble 40 (53)<br>UMD 41 (40)<br>Listen 43 (45)<br>Free skillpoints 72, e.g. for trap skills<br>Skills can be buffed further with ability increasing cleric spells<br><br><b>Combat vitals:</b><br>Hitpoints: 344<br>Saves F/R/W: 25/33/22<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells+5, Traps+2, Poison+5<br><br>AC naked/robes: 31.

You will lose one pre epic feat (e.g. Luck of heroes), one skill and have to live with lower strength. It can be painful to level the character, but if you make a straight lvl 40 build, Halfling might be the way to go.<br><br>The Ranger1/Cleric9 split gives access to lvl 5 Cleric spells. You start as Cleric and take Ranger at lvl 5 or later for the skill dump in stealth skills. Your BAB at lvl 20 will be 14 and you will have to increase wisdom to 15 at the cost of 1 dex or 2 str/con/int. You will also lose 8 skillpoints at start up.<br><br>If you drop Ranger and go with 2 Rogue lvls instead, you get evasion and 20 extra skillpoints. You will also be able to handle high DC locks and traps. You lose +1AB and will have to take all the TWF related feats, where ITWF in fact will give you a second off hand attack. Suggested feat list: Blind fight, Weapon finesse, TWF, Ambidex, ITWF, W focus, Extend spell, LoH (or Point blank shot). Here a Halfling will have no XP penalty!<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 11/06/06 20:33</span></i></p>

Just thinking ... couldn't you do this much more effectively by taking two monk levels? Evasion, wisdom to AC, and handy-dandy unarmed awesome?<br>_________________<br>CATS!
