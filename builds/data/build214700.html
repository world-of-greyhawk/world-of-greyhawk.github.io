This is a build that I've been toying with for some time. I've finally got it to the point where I don't actively dislike it, so I thought I'd post it. One thing to be aware of: this is a <i>very</i> similar build to Soul Reaper's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "130844", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pius Custos</a> build. The levelling is different and he goes for the Dev Crit line of feats, while I don't. However, the class splits are exactly the same and many of the feat choices are similar. But, I feel there's enough of a difference to warrant posting mine, as I take more CLC pre-epic to get some of the CLC buffs to kick in sooner and go about the build somewhat differently as well.<br><br>So, here's the Champion Protector:<br><br>PAL 15/CLC 15/CoT 10<br><br><b>Playable from 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>Human, Lawful Good<br><br>Domains: War and STR (I know Imp Invis is pretty much a default choice, but it doesn't fit the concept of this build, sorry.

While the Pally spellbook overlaps the Cleric's in many aspects, you still get a couple of decent Pally spells to work with, the most notable of which is Holy Sword. The extra spell slot provided by WIS of 18 will give you 2 castings of this spell per day. One big advantage of the overlapping spells is the character can use the Pally buff spells which leaves some of the Cleric slots open for others, if desired.<br><br>HPs are low for a melee build, but they can be boosted with an Endurance spell. Another option is to drop Blind Fight in favor of Toughness, but I prefer the former feat.<br><br>The AC isn't all that great, even in plate and shield, but it can be buffed with spells and Divine Shield to provide a pretty respectable boost.<br><br>One thought for this build would be to drop 2 more points into CHA and sacrifice 2 from STR. While this would only lower your AB by 1, it would raise the durations and effects of your Divine feats by 1 as well. Something worth considering.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/30/05 19:05</span></i></p>

Nice build... I tried it out with War/ Strength and then with Plant/ Healing and the latter seemed more well rounded with the 5 more AC and extra Heal spell giving the space to use more Harm spells. The low Charisma hurt the Cleric domain-abilities but are sometimes worth it.

I think you did a good job of creating a pretty well-balanced divine warrior, and one that has a lot of advantages for low-magic environments.<br><br>What I especially like is that you're not a cripple in the absence of your buffs, like so many buff-builds are.<br><br>The biggest weakness is, in my opinion, the AC.  I also kind of think you'd benefit alot by taking Cleave, instead of Extra Turning maybe.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thanks guys.<br><br>Xylo, the reason for the Extra Turning feat is his low CHA. With Turn Undead charges being burnt for both Divine Might and Divine Shield, I figured it was best to have his default be 11 charges as opposed to 5.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

If any feat should be dropped for Cleave I'd suggest Knockdown... in any level of magic world any creature an Human could Knockdown is most likely weak enough to beat straight up (or be vunerable to a Harm if they are just insanely powerful). I know it's not striving to be a DevCrit build but Cleave helps in more environments in my opinion than Knockdown could... cause honestly if you have a horde of dragon on your neck you'll be better of with Cleave than Knockdown.
