Here's one I just came up with a few days ago. Not a killer build...just a funny idea I came up with and had to see on the screen<br><br>Drunken Master<br>After training for years to the point of perfection as a monk, our character tired of the limitations of the human body. Seeking out a new teacher, he instead found alcohol...and thus began his journey along the path of the drunken master.<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>14str<br>16con<br>14dex<br>14wis<br>10int<br>8cha<br><br>Stat Progression:<br>Boost constitution at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 at the least...I did it again at 24, and then boosted str at 28, 32, 36, and 40.<br><br>Skill Progression:<br>Pre-Epic (All Monk Levels)<br>23 Hide<br>23 Move Silently<br>20 Persuade<br>20 Tumble<br>Rest of the points put into Discipline and/or Healing<br>Post-Epic (All Barbarian Levels)<br>Max out intimidate, then Discipline/Heal/Intimidate maxed<br><br>Level Progression:<br>20 * Monk<br>20 * Barbarian<br>Note: This requires an alignment shift from Lawful to non-lawful before taking barbarian levels...whiskey tends to do that to you.<br><br>Feat progression:<br>Human: Dodge<br>L1: Power Attack<br>L3: Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>L6: Great Cleave<br>L9: Mobility<br>L12: Spring Attack<br>L15: Toughness<br>L18: Blind Fighting<br>L21: Epic Damage Reduction I<br>L24: Epic Damage Reduction II<br>L27: Epic Damage Reduction III<br>L30: Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>L33: Epic Prowess<br>L36: Terrifying Rage<br>L39: Epic Reputation<br><br>The character ends up as:<br>Monk 20 / Barbarian 20<br><br>with stats:<br>Ending Stats:<br>18str<br>22con<br>14dex<br>14wis<br>10int<br>8wis<br><br>Ending HP's when I did the build came out to 587. Max HP's were a total of 680 (8 * 20 = 160 [monk hp's] + 12 * 20 = 240 [barbarian hp's] + 6 * 40 = 240 [con hp's] + 1 * 40 [toughness] = 680).<br><br>Base Attack 25<br>+33/+30/+27/+24/+21 attacks for 1d20+4 damage.<br>22 AC naked with no equipment.<br><br>Saves: 28fort, 24reflex, 24will<br>Spell Resistance 30<br>DR 13/- and 20/+1<br>Greater Rage 6xday with Terrifying Rage (dc of 51 will save or panicked 1-6 rounds -2 attack/saves)<br><br>Roleplay Suggestions: It's not 'Greater Rage'...that's the booze talking! Make sure to emote something like *finishes off his bottle of firewater* before going into a rage. This guy isn't great, but he's certainly durable, which was the idea when I made him. Good DR (13/- and 20/+1), SR (30), Saves (28f/24r/24w), and HP's (mid 500's to mid 600's) make him able to take a beating. He's not too nimble (22ac/20ac when raging) - he won't be dodging many blows - but when you're that drunk you really don't care anymore. I guess what I'm saying is that this guy isn't going to do hit-and-runs, etc, from a roleplay standpoint, and the build is designed to make them not make much sense...your best shot at winning a battle with the drunken master is to wade in and kill them all before they kill you.<br><br>Lastly, I started with Lawful Neutral as an alignment and shifted to True Neutral for the Barbarian levels - I figure that True Neutral best describes a complete devotion to drunkeness as a life's path. Just replace the forest obsession of those tree-hugging druids (as long as you don't hurt the forest, I'm fine with whatever happens) with the booze (as long as I'm drinking and in battle, I'm fine with whatever happens).<br><br>The Drunken Master is truly a master of both martial arts and of drunkeness, and have blended both into a harmonious state of inner peace and outer destruction.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 19:57</span></i></p>
