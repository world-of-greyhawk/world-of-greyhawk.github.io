hello,<br><br><br>     I was thinking of trying a monk/cleric on a server that has a subrace that will allow +2 dex, +2 int, and -2 char. So probably a dex based monk/cleric. i was looking at something like:<br><br>The Crippler by CrispyCritter <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "151185", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>probably the Rogue 19/Monk 6/Cleric 15 version, or which ever the experts deem the best.<br><br>any ideas?<br><br>If "The Crippler" is the build could someone take a carck at the leveling of this char.  CrispyCritter seems to leave these out and I always seem to mess the leveling of my chars up.<br><br><br>I guess i am thinking that monk/cleric synergy, the full 10 dual wield attacks, with all those buffs looks fun to play.<br><br>any suggestions?<br><br>thanks in advance,<br>Krylocke

Monk/Cleric is a great combination, the most important thing to know is if you want it as a caster type of melee type, since, blowing up WIS gives you nice DCs and AC, so it's a very viable caster at that, but you won't hit much unless you take Zen Archery, which can't be buffed as well as melee weapons.<br><br>I made 2 good Cleric/Monk builds, don't know if you would like them, they're very different from The Crippler:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "268568", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Lethal Kama (Cleric 20 / Dwarven Defender 18 / Monk 2)</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249788", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Magic Master (Monk 2 / Cleric 17 / Wizard 21)</a><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

yeh the dwarf there looks pretty good, but i was trying for a dex based that utilizes the kamas with 10 attacks.<br><br>I like the idea of the dwarven defender, but i heard that he breaks defensive stance all the time.<br><br>does anyone else have any ideas?

You don't really break stance, you just use Flurry of Blows instead.<br><br>Well, for the DEX based there's the Cleric / Monk / Rogue with Epic Dodge as the one you chose above, that's probably the best, since you need either 13 Rogue or 10 Assassin for Epic Dodge, and basically a DEX build with Epic Dodge will be better than all the options without it.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Yes, my mistake, I was thinking Shadowdancer and something else came up.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

You always have the third option - Monk 9/Shadowdancer 5 if ED is what you want.<br><br>Though in a monk/cleric build, there is little room pre epic for the required feats for both SD and ITWF.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
