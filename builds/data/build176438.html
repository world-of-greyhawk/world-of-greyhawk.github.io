This is my (feeble, pathetic) attempt at a Ranger/WM combination.  I included the fighter levels for the bonus feats and Weapon Specialization (which outweighs the loss of the extra favored enemies, IMHO).<br><br>Human, alignment any<br>STR 16<br>DEX 14<br>CON 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 12<br>CHA 08<br><br>1) Fighter 1, Power Attack, Cleave, Weapon Focus*<br>2) Fighter 2, Dodge<br>3) Ranger 1, Mobility, Favored Enemy 1<br>4) Ranger 2, STR+1 (17)<br>5) Fighter 3<br>6) Ranger 3, Expertise<br>7) Fighter 4, Weapon Specialization*<br>8 ) Ranger 4, STR+1 (18)<br>9) Ranger 5, Improved Critical*, Favored Enemy 2<br>10) Fighter 5<br>11) Ranger 6<br>12) Fighter 6, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, STR+1 (19)<br>13) WM 1<br>14) WM 2<br>15) WM 3, Great Cleave<br>16) WM 4, STR+1 (20)<br>17) WM 5<br>18) WM 6, General Feat**<br>19) WM 7<br>20) Ranger 7, STR+1 (21)<br>21) Ranger 8, Epic Weapon Focus*<br>22) Ranger 9<br>23) Ranger 10, Favored Enemy 3<br>24) Fighter 7, Epic Weapon Specialization*, STR+1 (22)<br>25) Ranger 11<br>26) Ranger 12<br>27) Ranger 13, Epic Feat**<br>28) Ranger 14, STR+1 (23)<br>29) Ranger 15, Favored Enemy 4<br>30) Ranger 16, Overwhelming Critical*<br>31) Ranger 17<br>32) Ranger 18, STR+1 (24)<br>33) Ranger 19, Epic Feat**<br>34) Ranger 20, Favored Enemy 5<br>35) Ranger 21<br>36) Ranger 22, Bane of Enemies, STR+1 (25)<br>37) Ranger 23, Favored Enemy 6<br>38) Ranger 24<br>39) Ranger 25, Favored Enemy 7, Devastating Critical*<br>40) Ranger 26, Favored Enemy 8, STR+1 (26)<br><br>* For weapon/shield setups, you'll probably want either a two-handed weapon (greatsword or greataxe, though a ranger wielding a greataxe would be odd RP-wise), dual-wielding (scimitars?), or one-handed weapon and shield (again, odd RP-wise for a ranger).  If you go the two-handed or one-handed+shield route, you could probably lower DEX to 13 and add that point to Wisdom, if you so choose.  (Myself... I prefer greatswords.)<br><br>** For the general feat, being the wuss that I am, I'd probably pick Toughness.  Knockdown would probably work here, as well.  For the two epic feats, either Armor Skin+Epic Prowess or Great [Something] I+II (Constitution or Wisdom) would work fine (I'd go with Armor Skin and Epic Prowess).<br><br>Skills are up to you-- just make sure to have Intimidate 4  before taking WM levels.<br><br>As for favored enemies, I'd take Construct, Undead, Outsider, Elemental, Monstrous Humanoid, Animal, Beast, and Human.  That's in general; if you know what groups of enemies you'll be facing with this build, change it accordingly.<br><br>Criticism welcome, as always.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bpberryWRC on 01/21/05 00:32</span></i></p>
