Since I am not at home and have no idea what the AC, Saves and all that are, I am posting this here.  I would like any feedback you could provide on this build.  My idea was to be able to use a bow, short sword &amp; Sheild and magic in combat.  Plus, I wanted to be able to get past all the locks and traps, set a couple myself and pretty much do anything I wanted...hehe<br><br>Halfling<br>Rogue 19 / SD 1 / Wizard 20<br><br>Stats <br>Strength  10 <br>Dex  18 (26)<br>Con  12<br>Intell  16 (22)<br>Wisdom  10<br>Charisma  8<br><br>level progression<br>1 Rogue Stealthy <br>2 Rogue <br>3 Rogue Dodge<br>4 Rogue  (Dexterity)<br>5 Rogue<br>6 Rogue Mobility<br>7 Rogue<br>8 SD  (Dexterity)<br>9 Rogue Point Blank Shot<br>10 Rogue<br>11 Rogue Improved Evasion<br>12 Rogue Skill Focus Move Silent (Dexterity)<br>13 Rogue<br>14 Rogue Defensive Roll<br>15 Rogue Skill Focus Hide<br>16 Wizard  (Dexterity)<br>17 Wizard<br>18 Wizard Spring Attack<br>19 Wizard<br>20 Rogue  (Dexterity)<br>21 Wizard Great Dex / Spell Penetration<br>22 Wizard <br>23 Wizard<br>24 Wizard Greater Spell Penetration (Dexterity)<br>25 Wizard <br>26 Wizard Epic Spell Penetration<br>27 Rogue Epic Dodge, Epic Skill Focus Hide<br>28 Wizard (Intellegence)<br>29 Wizard<br>30 Wizard Great Intellegence<br>31 Wizard <br>32 Wizard Great Intellegence (Intellegence)<br>33 Wizard Weapon Fenesse<br>34 Rogue <br>35 Wizard <br>36 Wizard Great Intellegence (Intellegence)<br>37 Wizard<br>38 Rogue<br>39 Wizard Epic Spells (Epic Warding &amp; Mummy Dust)<br>40 Rogue Epic Skill Focus Move Silent (Dexterity)<br><br><br>Skill Points 414<br>Concentration 42<br>Craft Armor 10<br>Craft Weapon 10<br>Disable Traps 10<br>Hide 43<br>Listen 43<br>Move Silent 43<br>Open Locks 12<br>Pick Pocket 10<br>Search 10<br>Spell Craft 42<br>Set Trap 10<br>Spot 43<br>Tumble 43<br>UMD 43<br><br><br>Feedback is appreciated.<br>_________________<br>May the Gods smile upon you!<br><br>Dezba

Hm, one thing I overlooked earlier: don't take SD1 pre-epic, you're losing BAB.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/25/06 19:01:28 (GMT) -- Kill A Lot A Crap<br><br>Wow, your right this build does not qualify for Epic Spells...

However, is +5 Hide/MS really worth three feats?

You lose one second and one sixth level spell.

As a caveat to Finn's suggestion, I'd decide between either focussing on melee or ranged weapons. I don't see the use of taking PBS if you're not going to go the extra step for Rapid Shot and don't also have Focus in your ranged attack. If you go the ranged route, then drop the KD feats. If you go the melee route, then drop PBS and pick up something else (Blind Fight would be my suggestion).<br><br>*edit* Don't bother with ESF:Hide either, since you've got Invisibility at your disposal.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 07/25/06 21:45</span></i></p>
