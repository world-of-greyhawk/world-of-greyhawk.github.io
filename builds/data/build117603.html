Here's an all around versatile combat rogue, who has hide in plain sight, 30 percent concealment, improved whirlwind, epic dodge and dual wields rapiers. His sneak attacks do strength damage, and he gets 14d6 of them.<br><br>starting stats:<br>strength : 14<br>dexterity : 18<br>constitution : 12<br>intelligence : 14<br>wisdom : 10<br><br>fighter skills to put max ranks in:<br>discipline<br>disable trap<br>open lock<br>search<br>save leftovers<br><br>rogue skills (2 skill points per level untill they max in each skill)<br>disable trap<br>hide<br>move silently<br>open lock<br>tumble<br>extra skill points in use magic device and search<br><br>all stat points in dex<br><br>levels:<br>fighter 2<br>rogue 3<br>fighter 3<br>rogue 3<br>shadowdancer 1<br>rogue 6<br>fighter 2<br>rogue 4<br>fighter 3<br>rogue 3<br>fighter 2<br>rogue 8<br><br>feats:<br>1 - ambidexterity / 2 weapon fighting<br>2 - weapon finesse<br>3 - expertise<br>4 - evasion<br>5 - uncanny dodge 1<br>6 - dodge<br>7 - mobility<br>9 - 2 skill points in every skill you have ranks in except tumble, extra 2 in move silently / weapon focus : rapier<br>11 - uncanny dodge 2<br>12 - max out hide, move silently, tumble, extra skill point in search / hide in plain sight / improved 2 weapon fighting<br>13 - max out all skills you have ranks in except search and use magic device, distribute points between the 2 fairly evenly.<br>14 - improved initiative<br>15 - improved evasion<br>16 - uncanny dodge 3<br>18 - spring attack<br>19 - weapon specialization : rapier<br>21 - defensive roll / great dexterity 1 / skill points distributed as for low level rogue mentioned above.<br>24 - epic dodge / great dexterity 2<br>25 - whirlwind attack<br>26 - improved whirlwind attack / great dexterity 3<br>27 - uncanny dodge 5<br>30 - epic weapon focus : rapier / crippling strike<br>32 - epic weapon specialization : rapier<br>33 - uncanny dodge 6 / great dexterity 4<br>36 - self concealment 1<br>37 - self concealment 2 / stop tumble at 40<br>39 - self concealment 3<br><br>final stats at level 40<br>strength 14<br>dexterity 32<br>constitution 12<br>intelligence 14<br>wisdom 10<br>charisma 8<br><br>attack bonus by level 40 using 2 mundane rapiers:<br>+36/+31/+26/+21<br>1-6 +8 (18-20/x2)<br>offhand:<br>+36/+38<br>1-6 +7 (18-20/x2)<br>he's got 14d6 sneak attack, can open just about any lock, naked hide and move silently of 54, naked ac 29 and he can use any scrolls or magic items. He's only got 265 hit points at level 40, but he's designed never to get hit, with both self concealment 3 giving a permanent 30% miss chance, and epic dodge making the first attack of the round automatically miss. He does 14d6 sneak attack damage, does 2 points of strength damage per sneak attack, and has a reflex save of 33 for defensive roll, and improved evasion.<br>his initiative is +15, so even without hiding in plain sight he's virtually guaranteed to get the drop on most opponents, to deliver the first sneak attack or hide in plain sight and guarantee that he gets one.<br>_________________<br>Save yourself some arm strain.
