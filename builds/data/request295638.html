Hey,<br>I'm playing on StormNexus (Lvls 1-40),<br>and characters with monk lvls there can't cast Haste and use Haste items.<br>I wanted to know if there is anyway to tweak the Exalted Sorc so I could still have that fine build just without the monk level.. Maybe 2 rogue lvls?<br>Sorc 37 // Paladin 1 // Rogue 2 sounds good?<br>And if so, when should I take the paladin &amp; rogues lvls?<br><br>thank you very much in advance, Oz Pere.

Without the monk level I would go with 36 Sorc/2 Rogue/2 Pally.  Take rogue levels at 17 and 37 for skill dumps; be sure to max tumble at eack level, and Paladin levels at 20 and 40.  Max discipline at each pally level as well  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>That gives you a +4 AC bonus pre-epic; quickest access to all spell levels and maxed out Discipline and tumble by level 40.<br><br>That's how I would do it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 04/22/08 11:53</span></i></p>

Alright, but why 2 pally? Why not 1?<br>And how come you chose pally at 20 and rogue at 17? Is there a reason for that?<br><br>Thanks alot!

If you are using rogue as your 3rd class instead of monk, you can't get that discipline dump with the rogue level alone so you need a second Pally level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>And how come you chose pally at 20 and rogue at 17?

Tumble adds a +1 to your AC for every 5 base ranks you have in it (points you added not counting Dex modifier, gear etc) so taking Rogue at 17 lets you add that first 20 points.  Leaving the pally level until 20 lets you reach level 9 spells as quickly as possible while still getting the tumble points in (18 levels of Sorcerer + 1 level of Rogue = 19.  Next available level for Pally is 20 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    ).  The same thing again at level 37; that nets you 40 Tumble points for a full +8 to your AC.  You can do it differently of course, that was just my suggestion to make it the most playable <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>If you want to keep it as much sorcerer as possible you can go 38 Sorcerer, then take Rogue at 39 and Pally at 40.  It is still a really powerful build, but you don't get all of your extra goodness until those last two levels that way.  <br><br>Alternately you can go to level 10 sorcerer (for level 5 spells; Stoneskin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   ) then take your first Pally level so you get your save bonuses quick.  Take Rogue at level 12 for early skilldumps this way, then continue on with Sorcerer up to level 36 again.  37 Rogue, and finally 40 pally would finish it off again.<br><br>Lastly, if you really want to max out the Sorcerer levels and "mirror" the Exalted Sorceress you can use Bard instead of Rogue.  Level 20 pally for your skilldump and saves, then level 40 bard for a Discipline and tumble skilldump.<br><br>Hope that helps!<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 04/22/08 13:41</span></i></p>

35 Sor 2 Pal 3 Rogue.  You're going to want Uncanny Dodge, since chances are you'll be wearing a robe and relying at least a little bit on your Dex score for AC.  36 1 3 if you can live without that extra Discipline dump.

Uncanny Dodge is nice indeed; but this build uses Plate/shield so it wouldn't do it much good overall.  Max 1 AC lost if it is caught flat-footed.<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

35 SOR/3 PAL/2 Rogue if you can fit Power Attack in there somewhere. That 3rd Pally level and Power Attack will allow you to take Divine Shield. (Oh, you'd also have to get your STR to 13 as well). Just a thought.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

The best third class IMO instead of Monk (or even better than Monk) is Blackguard, since Dark Blessing stacks your saves go sky high, you only need Cleave, the only problem is the alginment.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
