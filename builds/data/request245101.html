I'm out of ideas (and names) for builds right now, so I decided to make a NWN version of Amelissan Blackheart, also known simply as Melissan, from Baldur's Gate 2 Throne of Bhaal (yeah, I've been playing BG2 recently), and I'm looking for some criticism and suggestions before throwing it at the Epic Character Builds forum.<br><br>The thing is... it's pretty much impossible to make a build so uberly powerful, I'll give some specifics so that you get an idea...<br><br>She can cast practically anything, she always starts with Stoneskin, and also has Time Stop and Storm of Venegance (at least), she always casts Heal when she's near death and she casts lots of powerful summons of which I've seen Death Tyrants, Boneguards, Mariliths and Shadow Slayers, of course, those stuffs don't appear on NWN... but casting powers should be ok for summoning anyway. She needs to have at least level 9 spells from Wizard or Sorcerer and level 9 spells from Cleric or Druid.<br><br>The problem is that's not even half of it, she is also a strong force in melee, my -16 AC (that is quite high BTW) seemed like nothing against her, so her THAC0 (AB) must be supreme, her AC was regular, not that impressive, and she also had a strong DR, I guess around 50% or 60% (although that can't be translated exactly), she uses a long spear, which might get to be a halberd... for power, but I think I'll take spear to look more similar. I think that EDR would atually weaken the build, since she needs 19 WIS and INT, so adding 21 CON and 3 feats would leave nothing for STR... there is no space for Dwarven Defender levels either.<br><br>Joining that melee power with that casting power imagine how hard she beats you up since she goes melee on Time Stop and Heals when damaged.<br><br>Anyway, I came up with this: Cleric 17 / Fighter 4 / Wizard 19... she was human... initially, so Human for her, XP penalty comes anyway, I'd say it should be a level 40 build, I was thinking to take Cleric 17 / Fighter 3 pre-epic for BAB, and the final Fighter level would come until the very end for Discipline skilldump, but it won't be a problem in a level 40 build.<br><br>Eh... I think Plant and War for Domains are ok... to get Barkskin and Aura of Vitality.<br><br>Stats:<br>Str: 16 (26)<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 8<br>Int: 16 (19)<br>Wis: 16 (19)<br>Cha: 8<br><br>1 Cleric1 - Blind-Fight, Toughness<br>2 Cleric2<br>3 Cleric3 - Knockdown<br>4 Cleric4 - WIS +1 (17)<br>5 Cleric5<br>6 Cleric6 - Extend Spell<br>7 Cleric7<br>8 Cleric8 - WIS +1 (18)<br>9 Cleric9 - Empower Spell<br>10 Cleric10<br>11 Cleric11<br>12 Cleric12 - WIS +1 (19), Maximize Spell<br>13 Cleric13<br>14 Cleric14<br>15 Cleric15 - Silent Spell<br>16 Cleric16 - STR +1 (17)<br>17 Cleric17<br>18 Fighter1 - Weapon Focus: Spear, Improved Knockdown<br>19 Fighter2 - Improved Critical: Spear<br>20 Fighter3 - STR +1 (18)<br>21 Wizard1 - Epic Weapon Focus: Spear<br>22 Wizard2<br>23 Wizard3<br>24 Wizard4 - STR +1 (19), Epic Prowess<br>25 Wizard5 - Great Intelligence I (17)<br>26 Wizard6<br>27 Wizard7 - Armor Skin<br>28 Wizard8 - STR +1 (20)<br>29 Wizard9<br>30 Wizard10 - Great Intellignce II (18), Great Strength I (21)<br>31 Wizard11<br>32 Wizard12 - STR +1 (22)<br>33 Wizard13 - Great Strength II (23)<br>34 Wizard14<br>35 Wizard15 - Great Intelligence III (19)<br>36 Wizard16 - STR +1 (24), Great Strength III (25)<br>37 Wizard17<br>38 Wizard18<br>39 Fighter4 - Weapon Specialization: Spear, Epic Weapon Specialization: Spear<br>40 Wizard19 - STR +1 (26)<br><br><br>I haven't tested it yet... I'll calculate all the stats, skills and saves later, the do show basically, BAB 25, AB with a normal spear +37, all cleric and wizard spells, Cleric: 6/6/6/6/6/4/4/3/2/1, Wizard: 4/5/5/5/5/4/4/4/3/3<br><br>So, comments, tweaks, something...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/26/06 03:06</span></i></p>
