I am curious why you went Bard over Monk, even with your mention of it.  You'd net more AC if you dropped STR to 8 and DEX to 12 - and Divine Power would still buff your STR to 18.<br><br>Secondly, you mentioned Divine Might though but I assume you mean Divine Power, the spell?<br><br>Finally, I think dropping Max/Empower spell for Spell Pen./Greater Spell Pen. pre-epic, then picking up two Great Wisdom feats, or even Epic Fortitude and a skill focus feat would be more favorable.

But Clerics do.<br><br>Interesting, seems quite ok, I suppose you take Druid for Owl's Insight, granted, it's the best WIS buff in the game, but Druid isn't adding much to the build other than that, as for spells you'll need more DC, say, you could take a spell focus instead of Combat Casting, Improved Combat Casting and Epic Skill Focus.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/03/07 16:38</span></i></p>

I didn't take sling because of the Rapid Reload granting an Extra Attack.  The whole Divine Power + Rapid Reload + Haste exploit (well kind of an exploit) giving you some greate AB's for your xbow.  Read up on the xbow exploit (see Undead Xbow build).<br><br>I took wanted this build to have a TON of spells to choose from.  As a Cleric AND Druid, with lots of Wisdom, he'she could be able to take a large quantity of damage dealing spells.  Imagine how many Call Lightnings that can be taken!  Regular, Empowered, Maximized.  All that and you still have greate buffing with Cleric.  No AoO when you cast either.  Can't overcome their SR?  Then sniper them with your xbow.  Can't hit them with your xbow?  Then nuke them with a spell.<br><br>So Druid was not taken just for insight.  It was taken for Lots of spells that benefit from this high wisdom.

I'm not saying it's wrong to take Druid, and Owl's Insight is still awesome by itself, what I see is your crossbow will actually deal very low damage, you could take Fighter for EWS, and Druid isn't adding that much in this case... on another side, Bard could be changed for Fighter as well for damage, drop som Cleric or Druid for Fighter 4 or 6 and your xbow will deal much more.

Another reason for taking Bard that nobody's brought up yet... Use Magic Device.  A powerhouse by itself, allowing the use of some nifty arcane scrolls, I do believe.  Mage Armor anyone?<br><br>Also, someone mentioned that Monk adds a few AC due to the WIS bonus... with only 26 base WIS, it seems to me a Full Plate is the better option, especially in light of Use Magic Device.<br><br>People don't usually cross Cleric and Druid because of the spell overlap, but you seem to have capitalized on the strengths such a combo offers - many more spell slots and WIS synergy.  Casterlevels aren't so incredibly important, since you plan on flinging tons of basic damage spells willy-nilly.  Seems like a fun build to play, and the large amount of buffs it offers will be a great boon to any party.<br><br>A few last little suggestions.  Swap ESP for ESF: Evocation.  You want to beat saves, not SR, with that many Cleric levels.  Take Extra Music instead of the epic skill focus - discipline is high enough and your 1-song-a-day is a very shallow and short-lasting AB buff; 5x/day is way better.  Finally, some domain tweaks: Cat's Grace will not help you in a Full Plate, so take Magic domain over Death Domain, for Mage Armor and Ice Storm.  With Ice Storm, you could even leave ESP in if you want, since you can max it with no save!

Swap ESP for ESF: Evocation.  You want to beat saves, not SR, with that many Cleric levels.  Take Extra Music instead of the epic skill focus - discipline is high enough and your 1-song-a-day is a very shallow and short-lasting AB buff; 5x/day is way better.  Finally, some domain tweaks: Cat's Grace will not help you in a Full Plate, so take Magic domain over Death Domain, for Mage Armor and Ice Storm.  With Ice Storm, you could even leave ESP in if you want, since you can max it with no save!</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The monk would add evasion, and with a +8 base wisdom mod, that's quite a bit of AC.  Not to mention, empowered Owl's Wisdom would help some, and if you figure on wearing a wisdom amulet (since barskin is an available buff), it adds up.  UMD is far less important IMO than AC + evasion.<br><br>Dropping extra music for ESF: Discipline is a <i>bad</i> idea, as +1 AB for 10 rounds 5x per day isn't too helpful won't help against opponents who can KD you left and right.<br><br>And I'd keep ESP as 24 Cleric levels won't beat any high level monk's SR(even with ESP, beating SR tuned monks is out of the question).<br><br>Edit: I now realize that he does not have Spell Pen./Greater Spell Pen. (as I suggested in my first post), so ESP is out of the question, anyways. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 03/07/07 05:32</span></i></p>
