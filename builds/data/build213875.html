<b>Death's Rival</b><br>Rogue24/Ftr6/CoT10<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM, PvP</b><br><br>*** ***<br>"Hello! Anyone! Help!"<br><br>"What the blazes?" the old Dwarf scanned the slopes of Zandurey, and could vaguely see a figure dangling from one of the Black Spruces.  "Fool boy.  What's he doing up here?"  <br><br>The old Dwarf grabbed his walking stick and hiked his way across the ridgeline until he came to where he found a young boy, no more twelve years of age, dangling upside down from one of the many snares the old Dwarf had laid in the area to trap game.<br><br>"Help me, please! I've been trapped!"<br>"What are you doing up here, boy?  The Peaks of Zandurey is no place for a child.  Where are your parents?"<br>"I'm a runner for the King! I was sent to find a person known as Death's Rival.  The King said he retired and lived somewhere among these mountains.  Please, can you cut me down?"<br>"Aye, hold your britches." And the old Dwarf untied a few knots and gently lowered the boy to the ground. The boy jumped and brushed himself off.  <br>"You," he said, "You are him, aren't you?  Your Death's Rival!"<br>"Boy, calm yourself.  Death's Rival is dead.  Died a long time ago.  I'm just an old Dwarf who lives by himself in the mountains. Get thee gone, before I take a switch to your hide."<br>"That's what he said you would say."<br>"What?"<br>"The King, he said you would say that.  He said you would pretend to not be him, but told me not to be fooled." The boy paused and looked intently at him.  "I'm not fooled.  You are him, aren't you?"<br>"Listen boy, let's get one thing straight.  I'm not Death's Rival anymore.  That was me along time ago.  Now I am just Old Grimbeard. Got it?"<br>"Aye, milord, I got it.  But the King needs your help once again.  He says you owe him one, and he's cashing in."<br>"Did he now?" and the old Dwarf smiled.<br>"Milord, even now a huge invasion force is marching upon the borders of Cenelak.  Galadonians led by the Warlord Tharkas.  And the King requests that you join him at the Pass of Zandurey to aid him in repelling this invasion."  <br>The Dwarf was thoughtful for a moment.  <br>"He's no match for Tharkas," he muttered.  "And he knows it."<br>"Milord?"<br>"Let's go, boy! We haven't much time.  And when we get there, find a rock and stay under it!"<br>"Yes, sir!"<br><br>Old Grimbeard stood at the lip of the pass and overlooked the valley below him.   As far as the eye could reach could be seen the tips of spears and shining helms whose number rivaled the stars themselves.  And far behind them lurched the great siege machines in whose construction and skill Galadon was unmatched.  These were no skirmishing raiders-- this was an army of conquest.  And if they passed unchecked through the Peaks of Zandurey, Cenelak would fall.  <br><br>"Boy, how long until the King arrives with his army?"<br>"Milord, there at least a halfday's ride.  He said they'll be here by nightfall."<br>"Yeah, well, we don't have until nightfall."<br>"Milord?"<br>"Let's start moving rocks."<br><br>He watched them march in rank and file, each column five men wide and a 100 deep, and slowly begin their upward trudge to the Pass while in beat to the booming cadence of the war drums.  And at their head upon a coal-black warhorse rode the Arrikhan, Lord Tharkas, the Empire's foremost conqueror and general, scourge of kingdoms and deliverer of desolation.  Grimbeard studied him for a moment.  His armor was steel black, his great helm fearsome to behold, and in his hand he held a sword the length of a full grown man.  A wave of fear rippled around him in waves, and he his visage shone like some Battle God of the Old World.  Grimbeard recalled the tales and fabrications he had heard of Tharkas, how he had in one blow defeated the Champion Knight of Questilar, and had decimated singlehandedly that most renown order of Knights, and had then subsequently outlawed Knighthood and installed Questilar as a puppet kingdom of the Galadonian Empire.  Grimbeard began to consider that perhaps those tales were more than mere fabrication....<br><br>Old Grimbeard stood silently atop the rocks and boulders he and the boy had moved to block the pass.  His tattered grey cloak swirled in the mountain winds, and his snow white beard and hair were swept across his shoulders.   A group of riders broke from the main columns and galloped up the slopes to where he stood.  They studied the Dwarf for a few moments, unsure of what to make of him, and then their Captain spoke.<br><br>"Begone, old Dwarf!  This Pass is the property of the Divine Emperor of Galadon."<br><br>"Last time I checked, these were my mountains."<br><br>There was a pause and then laughter erupted from the men, and then the boy leaped from his hiding place among the rocks and yelled, "You shouldn't mock him so!  Do you know who this is?  This is Death's Rival, and it is you who better begone!"<br><br>Their laughter trailed off abrubtly and the Captain wiped a hand across his mouth, and locked eyes with the Dwarf.  He was met by a cold unwavering gaze.  The Captain observed a dozen scars crisscross the Dwarf's face like some caravan trade map.  He noticed the worn hilts of shortswords belted to each of his hips, and the gnarled hands that gripped him.  <br><br>And the Dwarf spoke, "Tell your General this:  if he wants this Pass, come and take it.  I'll not parley with his errand-boy who was but a suckling on his mother's breast while I waded in blood during the Wars of Morgirith.  Get thee gone, suckling!"<br><br>And the herald's face turned red with rage, and he glared at Grimbeard, but then wheeled his horse about and galloped back down the slopes, his entourage in tow.<br><br>"Get back under the rocks, boy," Old Grimbeard muttered.  "It's going to get ugly."<br><br>And he watched the heralds approach the Arrikhan.  There was a brief discussion, but Tharkas never moved in his saddle.  Then he made a slight motion with his left hand, and a contingent of archers moved up the hill.  They were 200 strong, and they marched until they were within 200 yards from where Grimbeard stood in the pass.  And then a series of fierce cries echoed across the slopes and a hundred painted savages, came bounding up the slopes.  They were some tribe, probably conquered and concripted by one of Tharkas' military victories, and were now his shock troops.  And Grimbeard immediately saw their plan.  While they came running up the slope, the archers would fire arrows over their heads to bring him down.<br><br>And the old Dwarf became instant energy, and he hurtled himself off the rocks and down the slope, trying to close the gap with the barbarians before the archers zeroed in on his frame.  The archers had already loosed their arrows and the sky was black with their feathered shafts.  The rocks clattered with the sound of falling arrows, but their intended target was already among the barbarians.  He crashed upon them, like a lion, slashing and roaring, and quickly had ringed himself with a circle of dead savages.  <br><br>The archers withheld their second volley for fear of hitting the barbarians, but the Arrikhan had appeared behind them and commanded, "Kill them! Kill them all!"  And so the archers filled the air with feathered shafts, and the sky grew dark again, and volley after volley was unleashed into the melee thick in which the Dwarf had disappeared.  The barbarians cried in dismay when they realized that their own bowmen were firing upon them, and the battle waged for several hot minutes.  But then all was still, and the archers held their fire.  Not a figure moved among the mound of the dead.  Hundreds of arrows sprouted from the corpses piled shoulder high near the top of the pass.  <br><br>And the Arrikhan laughed deeply, "Hah! Death's Rival indeed! Is this all Cenelak has to defend its borders?  One tired old Dwarf?  Archers, Galadonians, Legionairres, prepare to--"<br><br>"Milord," said the lead archer. "Look, there!"<br><br>And among the bodies something stirred.  It appeared to be one of the tribal warriors.  His arm moved, and then his whole body rolled over.  And climbing out from beneath came the Dwarf, besmirched in blood and filth and looking as grim as Death itself.  And in each hand he still held a blade, and he stood firmly atop the corpses and bellowed across the valley.<br><br>"Taunts and arrows?  Packs of gibbering savages?  Is this all you have, Tharkas?  Who are you going to send next to cover for your cowardice, children with knives?"<br><br>And Lord Tharkas, Supreme Commander of the Galadonian Army, roared in rage and threw his helmet among the rocks.  "Kill him!  Kill him!"<br><br>And the archers, each a seasoned expert in the bow, took careful aim and let loose one, two, three volleys of deadly arrows that would've felled an army.  But to the bowmen's amazement, Old Grimbeard stood calmly amidst the rain of arrows, and effortlessly dodged and sidestepped the black shafts, while others bounced harmlessly off his chest and legs.  And then the arrows stopped.<br><br>"Why do you stop?" Tharkas cried.  "He still stands!"<br><br>"Milord, we are out of arrows."<br><br>Tharkas glared up the slope at the Dwarf.<br><br>"Milord?"<br><br>"He's mine.  Stay here."<br><br>And Tharkas strode up the slope with the great blade in his hands and met the Dwarf.<br><br>"You were supposed to be dead!" Tharkas gritted through his teeth.<br>"Aye," Grimbeard said.<br>"The Emperor has no quarrel with you."<br>"Aye."<br>"You have no allegiance to Cenelak," Tharkas snarled, "Why do you defend her?"<br>"Because I owe her King.  He saved my life many years ago."<br>"Then you shall die."<br>"Aye," was all Grimbeard said, and he watched the Arrikhan inhale deeply while closing his eyes, and then a black flame sprang up the bloodgroove of the sword and hungrily licked the edges.<br><br>And in the same thought, in the same motion, the two figures leapt at one another.  And the two fought an epic struggle.  For three hours they fought, and for three hours they struck, parried and countered.  And Tharkas' army had crept up the slopes to witness the battle.  And the boy had crept from among the rocks and watched.  And still the Dwarf and the Arrikhan waged war on one another, until each bled from a dozen wounds, until the rocks beneath were stained red, until each were on one knee making wild lunges at the other, slipping on their own blood.  <br><br>"Hold!" Tharkas gasped.  He was on his hands and knees, and his black hair, so matted with blood and sweat, hung across his eyes and face.  "Why can't you die?"<br><br>And the Dwarf paused, also on hands and knees, and looked across at his adversary.  And he was about to reply when, in a sudden burst of energy, Tharkas sprang on top of him, knocked the swords from his hands, and pinned him to the ground.  He lifted his greatsword above him and plunged it through the Dwarf's chest.  But in the moment he had blinked his eye, the Dwarf had slipped just enough away to avoid a fatal blow, and the greatsword plunged through the Dwarf's arm instead, pinning him to the earth.  <br><br>And in that moment a shrill horn rang throughout the valley.  A single clear note reverberated off the rocks and mountain slopes, and Tharkas looked up the slope.<br><br>There, standing amid the broken rocks and boulders, stood a tall figure in shining silver armour, whose burnished shield reflected the setting sun.  He was the Warrior King of Cenelak.  And on either side of him appeared his Warrior Knights, each clad in silver armor, and whose shields all reflected the setting sun.  And in that instant, in that angle, Tharkas, stunned by their sudden appearance and blinded by the white relection, shielded his eyes and forgot about the Dwarf beneath him.  For Old Grimbeard was not finished yet, and his right hand searched for his blade and his fingers found the familiar hilt, and in that moment he sank the blade deep into Tharkas' back.  But it was surprise, not pain, that registered in Tharkas' eyes as he looked down at the Dwarf. "Why don't you die?" he asked.<br>"Because I cheat," Grimbeard snarled through his teeth, and then sank the blade to the hilt.<br><br>And Lord Tharkas, the Arrikhan, Supreme Commander of the Galadonian Legions, fell to the earth.<br><br>And a wave of fear rippled across the Galadonian force.  And the Warrior Knights of Cenelak roared as one and charged down the slopes and crashed upon the confused Galadonians.  The battle was short, and most of Tharkas' army broke ranks and fled.<br><br>And the Warrior King was found by the side of Old Grimbeard, tending to his wounds and wiping the old Dwarf's brow.<br>"I tried to save you some, lad," Old Grimbeard said feebly, coughing up blood, "but you know how I am about sharing..."<br>"Jord, you old fool!  How did you-- nevermind.  We thought you were slain!"<br>"I'm not dead yet, milord.  Could use an ale, though."<br>"Death's Rival, indeed. Soldier!" he called. "An ale for our friend here." And the King threw his head back and laughed. "And one for me as well."<br><br>And what a sight the Dwarf and King were, for they sat amidst the slaughter laughing and drinking, the King cradling the old Dwarf in his arm, while they spoke of adventures long past, and did so well into the night.<br>_______<br><br><b>Death’s Rival</b><br>Rogue24/Fighter6/Champion of Torm10<br>Dwarf<br>Alignment: Any<br>Playable: 1-40, PvM, PvP<br><br>Str12<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex16 (28)<br>Con18 (22)<br>Chr6<br><br>1 Rogue1, Ambidexterity<br>2 Fighter1, Weapon Finesse<br>3 Fighter2, Weapon Focus, TWF<br>4 Fighter3, Dex17<br>5 Fighter4, Weapon Spec<br>6 Rogue2, Knockdown<br>7 Rogue3<br>8 Rogue4, Dex18<br>9 Rogue5, Improved Knockdown<br>10 Rogue6<br>11 Rogue7<br>12 Rogue8, Improved TWF, Dex19<br>13 Rogue9<br>14 Rogue10, <i>Crippling Strike</i><br>15 CoT1, Toughness, <br>16 CoT2, Dex20,  Blindfighting<br>17 Rogue11<br>18 Rogue12, Iron Will<br>19 CoT3<br>20 Fighter5, Dex21<br>21 CoT4, EpicWeaponFocus, Great Dex I<br>22 Rogue13, Improved Evasion<br>23 Rogue14<br>24 Rogue15, Great Dex II, Dex24<br>25 Rogue16, Defensive Roll<br>26 Rogue17<br>27 Rogue18, Great Dex III<br>28 Rogue19, <i>Epic Dodge</i>, Con19<br>29 Fighter6, Epic Weapon Specialization<br>30 CoT5, Great Con I<br>31 Rogue20<br>32 CoT6, <i>Epic DamageReduction I</i>, Con 21<br>33 CoT7, Great Dex IV<br>34 CoT8, <i>Epic DamageReduction II</i><br>35 Rogue21<br>36 CoT9, Great Dex VI, Dex28<br>37 Rogue22<br>38 CoT10, <i>Epic DamageReduction III</i><br>39 Rogue23, Epic Prowess<br>40 Rogue24, Con22, Slippery Mind<br><br>AB: 40/35/30/25<br>Dualwielding: 38/33/28/23/38/33<br>AC: 27<br>HP: 584<br>SkillPoints: 334<br><br>Fort: 32 (34)<br>Reflex: 36 (38)<br>Will: 22 (24)<br><br>UMD: 42 (40)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Set Traps: 25 (34)<br>Search: 13 (15)<br>Persuade: 4 (2)<br>Open Locks: 10 (21)<br>Move Silently: 43 (51)<br>Hide: 43 (51)<br>Lore: 1 (5)<br>Listen: 43 (42)<br>Heal: 6 (5)<br>Discipline: 41 (42)<br>Disable Traps: 23 (25)<br>*** *** ***<br>Perhaps my favorite combination of classes to play and roleplay is the Rogue/Fighter/Champion of Torm.  This stems both because I like to solo through campaigns and mods, and also because I play with groups who don’t know their arse from a hole in the ground.  This combination, when combined with the Dwarven race, has a “mentor” feel to him, as he is able to do everything and do it well, and invariably is the last one standing.  <br><br>Based loosely upon <i>The Incredible Fighting Rogue of War</i>, I find this character exceptional, and in Epic levels I find him superior.  With Crippling Strike coming early at Lvl14, and with Epic Dodge coming at Lvl28 (attainable in HotU), supported by his steroid-esque hitpoints, and then the Epic Damage Reductions coming in from 32-38, topped by a tremendous skillset that is both Roleplay and PvP friendly, he has rapidly gained favor in my Stable over other builds, and has just a great balance of offense and defense.<br><br>Why <i>EDR III</i> in a Dex build?  EDR III means that you completely render useless WS/EWS and a strength buff or two that an opponent might be using against you.  Combine that with almost 600 natural hitpoints, Epic Dodge, and the ability to cast Improved Invis (via UMD), and you have a character who can out melee dedicated meleers.  Further benefits of acquiring a 22 Con is that you become highly resistant to Poison, Devastating Critical, Death Attack, Implosion, Weird, Wail of the Banshee, and the list goes on and on.  <br><br>Tests against my Leveller’s 40th Fighter bears this out:  this cat does nothing but spam IKD against me, has Dev Crit (lost many an Epic build against this), and starts combat by hasting himself, and then chaindrinks Heals when he gets to 25% HP.  I took this Dwarf and gave him no items, no weapons but 2 plain shortswords, and went at him with a 12 Strength and a 27 naked AC.  I did cast Improved Invis on myself with a scroll, but nothing else.<br><br>It was a long battle, and he nailed me many a time in spite of Epic Dodge and 50% Concealment, and I spent many a round laying upon my arse suffering AoOs.  During this titanic struggle, he drank 3 different Heal potions while I drank nothing and regenerated nothing.   The only sneak attacks I landed were from the opening salvo, and after that it was just base damage.  I did nothing fancy, no IKDs, no Bigbys, no anything, just scrapping with 2 rusty shortswords.<br><br> And by Jove and all the Hells, we had beat each other down until we were nearly dead, and he was out of Heals and potions, and my Improved Invis had worn off.  And what beat him, and what saved me, and where my other combat Rogues would have failed, was the EDR III.  It made all the difference.  It had taken just enough edge off each of his blows that landed, while Epic Dodge countered his most important attacks.  And I had beat him down with a 12 Strength, WS/EWS, and dull and cracked shortswords.<br>*** *** ***<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:45</span></i></p>

Great story. Manowar songs are rolling through my head.<br>A strong build, and I bet it's good in most situations. Fighter/Rogues is an old classic and experience tells me that epic dodge is a life saver, along with DR as you stated. And DR suits a Dwarf soooo well. Now I'm crossing my fingers for the Battlerager to appear in NwN 2.

I just can't resist to stand up fight at times and so whenever I've played other rogue builds this has gotten me in trouble. I guess sometimes too much pride to hide and sneak when I should. I feel this build can stand and fight with the best of them and duke it out without falling into the wimpy coward rogue role. This is more like the adventurer / mugger who you better give what he asks for or you'll get pounded lol. Also I can see how he can solo just about anywhere on his own and have no worries.<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!

The Rogue of War is stronger in pre-epic, IMO, but Death's Rival quickly outdoes him in Epic.  He gets Crippling Strike at Lvl14, and then gets Epic Dodge 2 levels earlier, gets a boatload more hitpoints, and gets more skillpoints to round out the great skill set.  The 9 DR combined with the 100+ hitpoints makes him a lot harder to kill than the Rogue of War, and he really doesn't lose any offensive potency.  The Fort saves are the same, and his will save is only 2 lower than the Rogue of War's, and he still sports a 34 Reflex save.<br><br>Thanks one and all for the feedback.

Lol, oopsie. Hit a couple nerves there. *blinks* Okay, a Dwarven Male is fun to play, I'll agree with you on that...but Dwarven Females?
