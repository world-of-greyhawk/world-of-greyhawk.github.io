For my first attempt at a published build, I would like to introduce Verity Forester, my Halfling Sneak Attacker (and subsequent runner away and hider) extraordinaire... Created for a hack 'n' slash module.

Elf would work well too (but would suffer from XP penalty) as would human (extra feats and skill points are always good).<br>* I have deliberately avoided weapn specific feats, hoping to have the ability to pick up the very best magical weapons available, and use them to hit for her +14d6 sneak attack, rather than get the odd crit! I am picturing dual-wielding daggers or kukris or using darts or shuriken for missile attacks, but any finessable weapon would work well. (Took Epic Prowess to bump AB up for all weapons instead)<br>* I will admit to being a HIPS-abuser. Verity is a firm believer in the better part of valour. Feats in general have been taken to avoid being hit when she is found in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>KD and IKD have been taken despite the small size of this sneak attacker to increase the number of sneak attacks hitting home. Given that she probably won't be trying to KD a dragon, she can probably get away with her small size. Avoid this problem by choosing human. Note though: I did take 2 levels of SD (I like darkvision!), so I am not completely abusing the prestige class for one feat!<br>* Took 6 pre-epic fighter levels to reach 4 attacks per round, and spread the other 4 levels through epic to keep discipline as a class skill and maxed out.<br><br>Pros:<br>* 14d6 sneak attacks<br>* Great skill levels. I chose 16 INT for this very reason.<br>* Self Concealment V and Epic Dodge. Just try to hit back!<br>* Ridiculously high dex means more finessed hits, lower AC (which can be kept most of the time thanks to Uncanny Dodge and high discipline), super reflex saves.<br><br>Cons:<br>* Low hitpoints (324) but with HIPS, SCV, Epic and Uncanny Dodge, this shouldn't matter.<br>* Fort and will saves suck. Slippery Mind helps though. Will look for magic to help here.<br>* True seers would mess up her escape plans a bit, but dodges and self concealment could help the getaway.<br><br><br>Skillpoints: 409 (Disable Traps 43, Discipline 42, Hide 43, Listen 43, Move Silently 43, Open Locks 25, Search 43, Spot 43, Tumble 43, UMD 41)<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/19/35<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 40 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 32/32<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 11/17/05 15:15</span></i></p>

Here is my skill progression. Discipline is to avoid knockdowns and being kept flat on her back taking hits on her precious few hit points. Hide and MS maxed for obvious reasons. Search, Spot, Listen for scouting duties (if only the rest of the party would stop walking into traps anyway - I suppose they don't want to wait for a halfling moving at 50% in stealth and search modes at the same time). Disable traps for self-preservation. UMD for fun. Lower open locks because she couldn't bash her way out of a wet paper bag. Tumble for escapes.<br>Set traps, Lore, Heal etc - all good skills but lower priority and even an INT 16 rogue has limited skill points. <br><br>01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Listen(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(8), <br>02: Discipline(5), <br>03: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), <br>04: Discipline(2), Save(3), <br>05: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(2), <br>06: Discipline(2), Save(3), <br>07: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), <br>08: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(3), <br>09: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(3), <br>10: Disable Trap(3), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(3), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(5), <br>11: Discipline(5), <br>12: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(2), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(2), <br>13: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(5), <br>14: Discipline(3), Save(2), <br>15: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(2), <br>16: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br>17: Discipline(3), Save(2), <br>18: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Tumble(2), UMD(5), <br>19: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br>20: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br>21: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br>22: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br>23: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(5), Save(2), <br>24: Discipline(7), <br>25: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Tumble(2), <br>26: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br>27: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(3), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(3), Tumble(1), <br>28: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(5), <br>29: Discipline(5), <br>30: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(2), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(2), <br>31: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br>32: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(4), <br>33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(5), <br>34: Discipline(5), <br>35: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), <br>36: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(2), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(2), <br>37: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(4), <br>38: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(5), <br>39: Discipline(5), <br>40: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Lore(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2),

It would be cool, but would commit me to particular weapon(s) which is a bit out of concept for this character. And for extra damage?

I would perhaps keep Iron Will and drop WP Exotic and take the weapon skills in dagger. If just PVM, I would tend to go my way.

Why WS/ES? Because Wpn Spec and EWS are great for Dex-Based rogues that are facing sneak-immune/crit-immune critters. If running away is how you like to face those encounters, then your build is all set <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   But I prefer to be able to dish out that extra damage especially when dual-wielding (since WS/EWS take effect on each hit with the weapon of choice). That's a possible +6 damage up to 6 or 7 times per round. If you can't HIPS and run away then having WS/EWS helps out when cornered.<br><br>If you have RP visions for this build that restrict it's optimization "...would commit me to a particular weapon(s) which is a bit out of concept for this character...", then it's good you've stated that.<br><br>Same goes for the high Int. You want it, that's fine. As for "I get SC5 anyway" yes, but so very late in the build. If you started with a higher Dex you could fit in SC5 a bit earlier in the life of the build.<br><br>Iron Will and low Wisdom - Yes, Will saves are a problem but in many environments magical gear is available to mitigate this. I myself usually opt to take the 2 stat points from Wis 10 and put them in Str, Dex, Int or Con and suck up the -1 to Will saves and/or rely on magical gear or scrolls.<br><br>As for Grim's comment that 'this build has been done before', I ran this build through pulse cap's Build Searcher and only found these similar builds:<br><br>Results from <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">pulse cap's build searcher:</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "206734", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Kukri’s Sting /Rogue 29/Fighter 10/SD 1</a> by darkfire_arrow01<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "124634", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Warden of Shadows /Rogue 31/Fighter 8/SD 1</a> by Nirrudn<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "207097", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Sneaky Sniper /Rogue 29/Fighter 10/Shadowdancer 1</a> by pulse cap<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither.

Nice build. Two things I would change though:<br><br>- as already mentioned Spring Attack is useless. Problem is what feat to take instead since you don't want to focus on a weapon. Perhaps Called Shot is a good idea.<br><br>- INT 16 is too expensive. I would take WIS 12 and CHA 10 (I just don't like to see a '8' on the char sheet <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ). The +1 to will saves would make slippery mind even more useful.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.

If you can't HIPS and run away then having WS/EWS helps out when cornered.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You are right of course. I'm not sure that the cost in other feats that you suggested is necessarily worth it, but I will take it under advisement.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Same goes for the high Int. You want it, that's fine. As for "I get SC5 anyway" yes, but so very late in the build. If you started with a higher Dex you could fit in SC5 a bit earlier in the life of the build.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The skills that I have chosen are important. Dropping INT, while it would give me some useful stat points, what skills would I lose? In my way of balancing it, having the skills up the whole lot of levels is more important than earlier SC. But I could be wrong (it happened once before!)<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Iron Will and low Wisdom - Yes, Will saves are a problem but in many environments magical gear is available to mitigate this. I myself usually opt to take the 2 stat points from Wis 10 and put them in Str, Dex, Int or Con and suck up the -1 to Will saves and/or rely on magical gear or scrolls.<br>Kaliban.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I suppose one less on Will saves won't make that much difference <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/16/05 22:17:36 (GMT) -- Kamiryn<br>- INT 16 is too expensive.

The +1 to will saves would make slippery mind even more useful.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>See above.
