Thanks to jjelison and his Dervish build for some inspiration.<br><br>I was intrigued by the Dervish build and wanted to try it as a halfling wielding 2 weapons.  But with the classes I needed, I couldn't swing enough feats to get 2 weapons, Dev Crit, and SelfConceal V.  So I decided a winged halfling would be a lot like an Imp, especially with powerful Bard/Curse Song and plenty of Taunt.  His buffs will be powerful and long-lasting with a caster level of 20.  And Improved Invisibility doesn't hurt either.<br><br>Halfling, any Non-lawful<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 15 (26)<br>DEX 18 (26)<br>CON 9 (12)<br>INT 10 (12)<br>WIS 8<br>CHR 12 (14)<br><br>Final AC (naked): 30<br>Final HP: ~300<br>Final BAB: +33/+28/+23<br><br>Level Allocation:<br>Bard x 5<br>RDD x 10<br>Bard x 6<br>SD x 10<br>Bard x 9<br><br>Raise CON (4th), STR (8th, 12th, 36th), and DEX (16th, 20th, 24th, 28th, 32nd, 40th)<br><br>Feats:<br>Level 1: Martial Weapon Proficiency<br>Level 3: Dodge<br>Level 6: Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>Level 9: Power Attack<br>Level 12: Cleave<br>Level 15: Improved Crit: Scimitar<br>Level 18: Mobility<br>Level 21: Curse Song<br>Level 24: Great Cleave<br>Level 27: Overwhelming Crit: Scimitar<br>Level 30: Great Dex I<br>Level 33: Great Dex II<br>Level 36: Epic Dodge<br>Level 39: Devastating Crit: Scimitar<br><br>This build was tested in "Novice to Epic Character Maker CEP Edition".  Feats can be taken when shown, and if skills are allocated correctly, PrCs can be as well.<br><br>As far as skills go, I only actually spent points when taking Bard levels.  So you'll have access to most skills without cross-class penalties.  Perhaps the build is too gimmicky, but I think it would be fun.

I don't know how necessary Lasting Inspiration would be.  With this build, I've got 20 uses of Song per day, which seems like plenty to me, but I've not played many high level bards.  <br><br>The other change I might make would be to take 13 levels of Rogue instead of Shadowdancer levels.  I'd lose Slippery Mind, HIPS, and the other special abilities, but gain 7d6 Sneak Attack.  Since I'm planning on having Improved Invis handle my stealth, I probably won't need HIPS.  And the Sneak would come in handy, especially if I'm using short swords.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

Nah stick with the levels you have. You get basically all the rogue bonus feat choices which is far mor useful. The reason for lasting inspiration, is that you can activate it, and it will stay going forever. You can then use curse song when you need to (keep in mind two songs can't be going at once even though NWN shows them both going). Normal bard songs last 10 rounds. Lasting lasts 100 rounds.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 08/08/04 13:54</span></i></p>

I would drop STR by one to start with and put those points in CON, then raise STR at 4th level instead of CON.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By realm of shadow on 08/09/04 01:28</span></i></p>
