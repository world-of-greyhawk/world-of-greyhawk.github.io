Hey all.  I'm after build details for hench and important NPCs.  I've posted this request here a couple of times for no joy.  The consensus from you folks, and rightly so, was that anything made with default packages would be a bit crappy.<br><br>However, Caereena 2 team (Skyrmir) has created an autolevel package that is 2da driven ie we can tell the hench/critter EXACTLY how to level-up, level by level, including which class, ability, skills, feats etc (even spells) to take at each and every level.  This means that we can duplicate the builds you guys come up with perfectly.<br><br>We just need the data...<br><br>If you would like to see one of your builds featured in a module that will automatically go HoF, and is being created by arguably the most talented team ever assembled in the NwN community, then please post build details here or send them to  <a href="mailto:ozdallo@gmail.com.">ozdallo@gmail.com.</a><br><br>We need <i>precise</i> data regarding exactly what is chosen each level all the way to level 40.  We don't necessarily need super-power builds, though a few would be sweet, but even info on builds that you've enjoyed playing and/or are a bit different. <br><br>Thanks in advance <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>(the halfling paladin bows deeply..)

I'm a bit disappointed by this lack of response.<br><br>You all want high-level combat mods, right?  And there are hardly any decent ones out there.

If you want skill progressions, you'll probably have to request them. They're a pain in the arse to do and don't really make sense if done on paper though Kamiryn's CBC makes it 100x (quite literally!) easier to plan skills <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>As for spells, that can't be too hard, can it? O_o Ask someone more experienced (not me) to do a generic ranking of spells etc by general cheesy uberness (you know the usual - Protection from Alignment, IGMS), suitable for mod-playing. <br><br>And as for being ignored, one of my requests for info on prestige class summons was ignored but later someone else asked on the general discussion boards and got answered o_O. You might get a better response through actually PMing any individual members you want to contribute - the board's notifications of what's been read etc aren't exactly 'intelligent', and NWN is an old game now. I imagine there's a lot less guild activity than there once was (and certainly a lot less than other games I've played - this ain't an RP guild either), so responses are equally as sparse. Anyhow, I don't get too frustrated - we try to be helpful (most of us anyway - can't say about Kaliban if he does'nt like you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  or me in a bad mood &gt;:) )but we're not perfect.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

If I've offended anyone here with my 'tone' then I apologize.  I'm a grumpy old bastard sometimes, I admit it...<br><br>I know this isn't a support group as such, but even so where else would a builder go for such expertise other than the general forums?  <br><br>I love messing about with the toolset, obviously, but any author/modmaker who doesn't consider h/her audience above all else is foolish.  I copped a bit of flak from some players with my first mod because for many char builds it was just too easy.  For a combat-oriented product obviously this isn't very good news, especially when i spent so much time on balance issues.  I want to get it right this time, and I do think it fair enough for an author to make requests in a guild like this when the outcome will effect many of its members ie those who might play the product.  <br><br>And btw, avado, my life is just fine.  I suggest you examine your own tone.  I've got a good job, a wife and 2 kids whose lives I'm involved with in many ways, and I'm basically a happy man.  I hope you are so lucky.  The above's got nothing at all to do with an invention not working, or being ignored.  It's a great piece of code.  It works fine.

Probably medium in the latter, though we only managed RP light in the first instalment.  The storyline is epic, as it should be when dealing with PCs of levels 30+, I guess.  The first mod has 20-30 hours of game play depending on class and exploration.  We're aiming for perhaps half that at this stage with the sequel.<br><br>And please do recommend your own builds!  I'm not absolutely sure exactly what we're looking for, to be frank, but we need variation and obviously we can write in anything cool.  We've actually got 2 level-up mechanisms: the 2da-driven one I've mentioned for hench and other important NPCs and also another one that works on an OnEnter area scan.  The latter only uses default packages but we can manipulate level difference (NPC level minus PC level) and it seems good enough for general combat purposes.

Skill point distributions are most needed if the class balance is different from pre-epic to post epic in a build, especially if you're say, mixing Rogue and melee classes because of the massive disparity between how many skill points per level those classes get. If they're similar, it's less needed.<br><br>Say, if you're taking 16 Fighter/4 Rogue pre-epic, and then another 4 Fighter levels and 16 Rogue, you're going to get a LOT more skillpoints in your epic levels than pre-epic. You might end up with a heap of skillpoints but won't really be able to spend up in skills until your epic levels. It can be quite a pain, actually.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

@ FinneousPJ:  delimiting the spell list in some way might indeed be the easiest way to go (especially since I'm almost certain we can assign what we want on the last level).  The only problem with this scenario is, again, stoopid AI.  It's possible that they'd just keep casting the same spell again and again....<br>We didn't have this autolevel system(s) in CKR, and I had to make each and every creature according to the situation.  What I did was erase their spell lists and went for special abilities only.  This allowed very good control over exactly what they'd cast, obviously, but it was a LOT of work and hardly ideal...<br><br>Hmmm...Thinking about it now I'm actually not completely sure whether special abilities are channelled through feats such as spell penetration/focus etc.  Certainly the epic spells aren't, I know.  One to check out...<br><br>At the moment all we have is standard AI, though as I've indicated there are ways to mess with it.  We are checking out what's available, including tony k's and Jasperre's stuff.  What we are endeavouring at all costs is to try to avoid anything which seriously overwrites Bioware stuff.  Too many unknowns and possible stuff-ups.  nereng's hench code at the moment looks most promising (uses tony k's and a lot of his own stuff).<br><br>Thanks for the link to that bard build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   Looks sweet!<br><br>@ Jennalee: the beauty about skills is that you can save them for a later level-up.  As long as we ensure that the ones required for prestige classes etc etc are assigned then we can probably save the remainder for the last level.  This is why I'm particularly excited about the links I've seen from you guys ie they show final skill distribution <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>@ dwarflord:  unfortunately, mate, sneak attack is considered a subset of critical hits.  You <i>can</i>, I'm almost certain, assign immunity to sneak attack without it affecting critical hits, but as soon as you assign critical hit immunity it takes out sneak attack as well...<br>The reasons for this being the case are actually quite compelling in DnD lore, but obviously in this scenario it's a pita.<br>What we intend to do, as I've indicated, is check whether the PC (and maybe the hench too) have the Dev Critical feat and assign critical immunity to certain critters in this circumstance.  This actually won't occur that often, just with certain plot monsters etc.  Most rogue builds, I'd think, wouldn't have the feat and so won't be affected.    Also, we plan to have a time limit on this immunity in some way ie it's a temporary thing (maybe associated with a vfx so the PC will know it's occurring) and have it brought down in a variety of ways.  Maybe the PC will have to kill all the minions first, maybe there's a small puzzle to solve, maybe it's linked to critter hitpoints etc etc.  We'll come up with interesting ways to do this <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   We just don't want fights that should be seriously challenging being over in a single whack.  We could assign a high fortitude save instead, but my feeling is that this would seriously compromise too much other stuff. <br><br>I understand your concerns very well though, mate, and honestly am wide open to any and all suggestions about this issue.
