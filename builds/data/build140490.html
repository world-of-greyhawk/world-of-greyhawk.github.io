Hey all.  Another try at a build.<br><br>I like the idea of a Construct Shifter.  I know everyone is all over Dragons, but I hadn't seen a Construct build yet so I've given it a shot.  Lots of fun, actually.  So here goes:<br><br>Alignment: Lawful Neutral (must be)<br>Race: Gnome (could be anything, though -- I liked the idea of a small character turning into a huge golem, and gnome special abilities are more useful than halfling abilities in this case)<br><br>Stats<br>STR 10<br>DEX 14 (16 at lvl 40)<br>CON 10<br>INT 12<br>WIS 18 (28 at lvl 40)<br>CHR 8<br><br>Final Naked BAB: +29/+26/+23/+20/+17<br>Final Naked AC: 35<br>Final HP: I had close to 400<br>-And these are not in Iron Golem Form-<br><br>Level Breakdown:<br><br>Level 1 -- Monk<br>Skills: Discipline 4, Lore 4, Persuade 4, Tumble 4<br>Feats: Alertness<br><br>Level 2 -- Monk<br>Skills: Discipline 1, Lore 1, Persuade 1, Tumble 1<br><br>Level 3 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: Dodge<br><br>Level 4 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br>DEX 1<br><br>Level 5 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 6 -- Monk<br>Skills: as above<br>Feats: Circle Kick<br><br>Level 7 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 8 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br>WIS 1<br><br>Level 9 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br><br>Level 10 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 11 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 12 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: I took Blindfight, but this would be a good place for Improved Crit: Unarmed<br>WIS 1<br><br>Level 13 -- Druid<br>Skills: Max Spellcraft (16), Lore 1<br><br>Level 14 -- Druid<br>Skills: Lore 1, SC 1<br><br>Level 15 -- Druid<br>Skills: as above<br>Feats: Toughness<br><br>Level 16 -- Druid<br>Skills: As above<br>WIS 1<br><br>Level 17 -- Druid<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 18 -- Druid<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: Improved Initiative*<br><br>Level 19 -- Druid<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 20 -- Druid<br>Skills: As above<br>WIS 1<br><br>Level 21 -- Shifter<br>Skills: Lore 1, Spot 1<br>Feats: Armor Skin<br><br>Level 22 -- Shifter<br>Skills: Lore 1, Spot 1<br><br>Level 23 -- Shifter<br>Skills: Lore 1, Spot 1<br><br>Level 24 -- Shifter<br>Skills: Lore 1, Spot 1<br>Feats: Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>WIS 1<br><br>Level 25 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 26 --  Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 27 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: Great Wisdom I<br><br>Level 28 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br>WIS 1<br><br>Level 29 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 30 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: Great Wisdom II<br><br>Level 31 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 32 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br>WIS 1<br><br>Level 33 -- Shifter<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: Construct Shape, Superior Initiative*<br><br>Level 34 -- Monk<br>Skills: Max Discipline, Max Tumble, Lore 1<br><br>Level 35 -- Monk<br>Skills: Discipline 1, Lore 1, Tumble 1<br><br>Level 36 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br>Feats: Epic Prowess<br>DEX 1<br><br>Level 37 -- Monk<br>Skills: As above<br><br>Level 38 -- Druid<br>Skills: Max Spellcraft, Lore 1<br><br>Level 39 -- Druid<br>Skills: Lore 1, Spellcraft 1<br>Feats: Epic Toughness I*<br><br>Level 40 -- Druid<br>Skills: Lore 1, Spellcraft 1<br>WIS 1<br><br>I also ended with 25 unused skill points.  Obviously, you can put them wherever you'd like.  I'd consider some Search or some more Persuade.  And feats with an * are optional.  I even came up with some backstory to explain it all, so if people are interested, I'll post.  Otherwise, let me know what you think!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/25/08 02:27</span></i></p>

So I'd take it at the lvl 6 mark.<br><br>I think the 2 points added to dex could be better spent added to wisdom instead.  You'll still get the AC advantage and you'll also improve your DC rating on your stunning fist attack. Not to mention a few more druid spells.  When shifted, the DEX of the creature form overlays your true form, so those 2 DEX points you added would be lost in creature form.  WIS would remain.  You would loose a point on your reflex save and 1/5 points to tumble ac.<br><br><br>Since you'll have a very high wisdom, maybe zen archery would be a good call also.  Might be handy to help lvl the character.<br><br>At 12, I'd take the Improved Crit on UA as you pointed out.<br><br>lvl 15 or 18 I'd take extra stunning fist and maybe spell penetration.  I think spike groth would be handy to cast prior to battle with a large group, the spell penetration might come in handy at that point.  The spikes could disrupt spellcasters I think.

The other reason to raise WIS instead of DEX is WIS carries over into shifted forms where as DEX does not.

Yeah, this is an early build for me.  So the attribute allocation isn't as efficient as it could be.
