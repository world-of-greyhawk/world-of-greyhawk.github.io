I've been playing dwarven defenders for so long that it never dawned on me that having offense would be a nice addition to my defensive capabilities.  So, I sat down with my favorite character creator excel sheet and drew up this dwarven barbarian.  He was inspired by Phrostbyte's "Dwarven Barbarian That Won't Die."  He's an offensive juggernaut that destroys all in his path.<br><br>Barbarian 32 / Fighter 8<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 PvM,</b> <i> maybe even PvP depending on the items.</i><br><br>Dwarf, Chaotic Neutral<br><br>Str 16 (26)<br>Dex 10<br>Con 19 (21)<br>Int 13<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 6<br><br>01: Barbarian(1): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>02: Barbarian(2): Bb: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>03: Fighter(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br>04: Fighter(2): CON+1, Great Cleave, (CON=20)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): Knockdown, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>07: Barbarian(3)<br>08: Barbarian(4): CON+1, (CON=21)<br>09: Barbarian(5): Improved Knockdown<br>10: Barbarian(6)<br>11: Barbarian(7)<br>12: Barbarian(8): STR+1, Improved Critical: Greatsword, (STR=17)<br>13: Barbarian(9)<br>14: Barbarian(10)<br>15: Barbarian(11): Toughness<br>16: Barbarian(12): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>17: Barbarian(13)<br>18: Barbarian(14): Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>19: Barbarian(15)<br>20: Barbarian(16): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>21: Fighter(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>22: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>23: Barbarian(17)<br>24: Barbarian(18): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br>25: Barbarian(19)<br>26: Barbarian(20)<br>27: Fighter(7): Great Strength II, (STR=22)<br>28: Fighter(8): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword, (STR=23)<br>29: Barbarian(21)<br>30: Barbarian(22): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>31: Barbarian(23)<br>32: Barbarian(24): STR+1, Mighty Rage, (STR=24)<br>33: Barbarian(25): Epic Damage Reduction II<br>34: Barbarian(26)<br>35: Barbarian(27)<br>36: Barbarian(28): STR+1, Epic Damage Reduction III, Terrifying Rage, (STR=25)<br>37: Barbarian(29)<br>38: Barbarian(30)<br>39: Barbarian(31): Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>40: Barbarian(32): STR+1, Thundering Rage, (STR=26)<br><br>Hitpoints: 704<br>Skillpoints: 199<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/15/16<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 12/23<br><br>Discipline 43 (51)<br>Heal 43 (42)<br>Intimidate 43 (54)<br>Listen 7 (6)<br>Taunt 43 (41)<br>Tumble 10 (10)<br><br>01: Discipline(4), Heal(4), Intimidate(4), Taunt(4), Save(4), <br>02: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>03: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>04: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>05: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>06: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>07: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(5), Taunt(5), <br>08: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>09: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>10: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>11: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>12: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>13: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>14: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>15: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), <br>16: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>17: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>18: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>19: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>20: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>21: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>22: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>23: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(3), Taunt(3), <br>24: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>25: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>26: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>27: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>28: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br>29: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(3), Taunt(3), <br>30: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>31: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>32: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), <br>33: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), <br>34: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), <br>35: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), <br>36: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), <br>37: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), <br>38: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), <br>39: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), <br>40: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), <br><br>The biggest weakness I can see is that tiny brain of his.

Overwhelming crit is a bit overrated.  For the feats involved, I find your character can be much more effective with a few tweaks:<br><br>Drop great cleave and skill focus(it is only 3) and replace those with Expertise(for situational AC boost) and Blindfight(a must for any melee character).  Then replace overwhelming crit with armor skin.<br><br>Over all, a pretty straight up skull smasher who should kill first and collect shiny things later. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 10/05/05 00:26</span></i></p>

Cool build. My suggestion would be to drop Over Crit and take DR I as your FTR 8 bonus feat. Then take GRT CON I at level 30. That will net you +1 on your Fort saves and 40 more HPs at the cost of only 1d6 damage on a crit.<br><br>That may actually serve to free up Toughness for Blind Fight. Personally, I'd keep Skill Focus:Intimidate, since you're suffering a -2 on Intimidate from your CHA. That way, you end up with a net +1.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

What about taking 4 levels of CoT in place of Fighter to get a small boost to saves? I did that with my Barb 30/Ftr 4/CoT 6 and liked the result.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>The people he knew were less than golden-hearted<br>Gamblers and robbers, drinkers and jokers, all soul searchers<br>Like you and me

I'm going to keep great cleave vice toughness.  In playtesting, he hits pretty hard with a greatsword.  He was able to, on a fairly consistant basis, hit for 40+ damage and even great cleave a few ogres.  That's worth it to me.<br><br>King Harbromm
