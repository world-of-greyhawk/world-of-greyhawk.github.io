Looking at making my first monk build to get advantage of the multiple attacks.  Would like to get monk to about level 6 - 8 other classes dont matter to me.  Need high ab and ac (doesnt everyone)and +12 ability modifers can be easily reached and +5 is highest armor/sheilds/weapons.  To survive in my current pw need at least ac into 60's and ab into 60's also. Dont know if that is possible but I guess I will leave it up to the experts here to tell me

To get AB that high I think you'll want to use Weapon Master. Maybe Monk 6/Fighter 6/Weapon Master 28 with kamas. More Fighter levels if you need more feats. It'll be DEX based of course.
