The Duskblade Adept (PvM, perhaps PvP lite, playable levels 1-40)<br><br>-----<br><br>One of my favorite character types in Baldur's Gate II was always the Fighter/Mage/Thief.  There wasn't much you couldn't handle.  Basically, you would start off using Hide in Shadows, come up behind someone, and backstab them.  Your fighter levels meant that your THAC0 was low enough that you generally hit them.  If they had spell protections, you could use your mage spells to knock them out.  Then, in the middle of any fight, you could always cast an invisibility spell (and there was one at almost every level) and get in another backstab.  And, if all else failed, you could just sit in there and duke it out, maybe not as well as Minsc, but well enough to get by.<br><br>This is my attempt to recreate the glory (or, perhaps, nefariousness) using the NwN adaptation of D3D rules.  I've taken some liberties with class selections in order to add both interest and feasibility to the build, but the fundamental concept and play style should prove very reminiscent of walking up behind that mage next to Gromnir, killing him in one hit with a backstab, taking out the other mage with a single Finger of Death, casting Stoneskin, and settling in for a good brawl.<br><br>-----<br><br>Race:  Human<br><br>Alignment:  Any evil<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Str:  14<br>Dex:  16<br>Con:  10<br>Int:  10<br>Wis:  8<br>Cha:  16<br><br>1 - Rogue 1 - Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 - Rogue 2<br>3 - Sorcerer 1 - Extend Spell<br>4 - Sorcerer 2 - Dex 17<br>5 - Sorcerer 3<br>6 - Sorcerer 4 - Weapon Finesse<br>7 - Rogue 3<br>8 - Rogue 4 - Dex 18<br>9 - Rogue 5 - Weapon Focus (rapier)<br>10 - Rogue 6<br>11 - BG 1<br>12 - Rogue 7 - Blind Fight, Cha 17<br>13 - BG 2<br>14 - BG 3<br>15 - BG 4 - Divine Might<br>16 - BG 5 - Cha 18<br>17 - Rogue 8<br>18 - BG 6 - Divine Shield<br>19 - BG 7<br>20 - BG 8 - Dex 19<br><br>21 - Sorcerer 5 - Epic Weapon Focus (rapier)<br>22 - Rogue 9<br>23 - Sorcerer 6<br>24 - Sorcerer 7 - Maximize Spell, Dex 20<br>25 - Sorcerer 8<br>26 - Sorcerer 9<br>27 - Rogue 10 - Great Dex 21, Improved Evasion*<br>28 - Sorcerer 10 - Dex 22<br>29 - Sorcerer 11<br>30 - Sorcerer 12 - Great Dex 23<br>31 - Sorcerer 13<br>32 - Rogue 11 - Dex 24<br>33 - Sorcerer 14 - Great Dex 25<br>34 - Sorcerer 15<br>35 - Sorcerer 16<br>36 - Sorcerer 17 - Epic Prowess, Cha 19<br>37 - Rogue 12<br>38 - Sorcerer 18<br>39 - Rogue 13 - Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll*<br>40 - BG 9 / Sorcerer 18 / Rogue 13 - Dex 26<br><br>*Rogue bonus feat<br><br>Skills:  Concentration 43(43), Discipline 43(45), Hide 42(49), Move Silently 42(49), Spellcraft 15(15), Tumble 40(48)<br><br>-----<br><br>Ending Stats:<br>Str:  14<br>Dex:  26<br>Con:  10<br>Int:  10<br>Wis:  8<br>Cha:  19<br><br>AB (rapier):  +38/+33/+28/+23<br>-Extra attack from Haste<br>+2 from Maximized Cat’s Grace<br>+5 from Greater Magic Weapon<br>-5 (when activated) from Power Attack<br>+7 (on smite) from Smite Good<br>Buffed AB (rapier):  +45/+45/+40/+35/+30 (-5 w/ Power Attack, +7 on smite)<br><br>Damage (rapier):  3-8 (critical 18-20/x2)<br>+1 (at least) from Bull’s Strength<br>+5 from Greater Magic Weapon<br>+1d4+10 from Flame Weapon<br>+7 from Divine Might<br>+5 (when activated) from Power Attack<br>+9 (on smite) from Smite Good<br>Buffed Damage (rapier):  27-35 (critical 15-20/x2, +5 w/ Power Attack, +9 on smite)<br><br>AC (robes):  26<br>+4 from Haste<br>+2 from Mage Armor<br>+4 from Shield<br>+5 from Shadow Shield<br>+2 from Maximized Cat’s Grace<br>+7 from Divine Shield<br>Buffed AC (robes):  50<br><br>Max HP:  240<br><br>Saves:<br>Fortitude:  23 (+3 vs. spells)<br>Reflex:  31 (+3 vs. spells, +2 vs. traps, Improved Evasion)<br>Will:  21 (+3 vs. spells)<br><br>Buffed Saves (Maximized Eagle’s Splendor, Maximized Cat’s Grace, Resistance):<br>Fortitude:  27 (+3 vs. spells)<br>Reflex:  37 (+3 vs. spells, +2 vs. traps, Improved Evasion)<br>Will:  25 (+3 vs. spells)<br><br>Sneak Attack Damage:  9d6<br><br>Spells:<br>0:  Acid Splash, Daze, Electric Jolt, Flare, Light, Ray of Frost, Resistance<br>1:  True Strike, Grease, Mage Armor, Shield, Magic Missile<br>2:  Cat’s Grace, Eagle’s Splendor, Darkness, Flame Weapon, Ultravision<br>3:  Greater Magic Weapon, Haste, Vampiric Touch, Find Traps<br>4:  Improved Invisibility, Ice Storm, Elemental Shield, Stoneskin<br>5:  Bigby’s Interposing Hand, Energy Buffer, Mestil’s Acid Sheath, Lesser Mind Blank<br>6:  Isaac’s Greater Missile Storm, Greater Spell Breach, True Seeing<br>7:  Shadow Shield, Bigby’s Grasping Hand, Spell Mantle<br>8:  Bigby’s Clenched Fist, Greater Sanctuary<br>9:  Time Stop<br><br>The spell list is, of course, flexible, and can be modified to suit personal taste and playing style.<br><br>-----<br><br>Strengths:<br>-Very versatile<br>-4 attacks<br>-Very high buffed AC<br>-High buffed AB<br>-Good buffed damage<br>-Level 9 arcane spells<br>-Epic Dodge<br>-50% concealment from Improved Invisibility<br><br>Weaknesses:<br>-Low caster levels, can't deal with SR at all, can't use spells with saves<br>-Pathetic HP.

The threat range should be 18-20, not 15-20.  I forgot to change it back after I removed Improved Critical from the build, and it's too late for me to edit.  Apologies.

Looks like you've come up with a reasonably effective sorcerer spellsword build without using RDD - kudos on that, making a good spellsword out of a sorcerer is pretty challenging.  And you get bonus points for using blackguard, and although I already mentioned it, more bonus points for not using RDD.  <br><br>That said I do have some suggestions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>This character seems like he'll have a lot of utility and reasonable, though not spectacular, defense.  But he lacks offensive punch due to his low AB (sneak attacks that don't land, don't count), and lack of casting levels for magical offense.  +45 isn't really high for a buffed AB, self or not; it's a fairly high unbuffed AB, such as you'd probably get in a warrior-centric RDD or WM build.  Don't forget that the most AB you can possibly get from buffing is +20 to-hit and +6 from stat increases for a total of +26.  The highest this character's AB can go is +64.<br><br>And I'll be frank - I don't really know of many truly "low magic" worlds that let you go to level 40 such that a specialized fighter won't be able to get equipment that duplicates the effects of your buffs, putting their AB into the low to middle +70s.  If you can do something to raise your BAB, I'd do it.<br><br>I think your biggest hurdle in this build is your hitpoints, however, or rather the lack thereof.  Particularly in light of how late epic dodge comes into play for your build.  I seriously doubt you will find much success PvPing using a build that has less than 400 unbuffed hitpoints, for that matter.<br><br>For feat selection:  I'd consider exchanging maximize spell for empower spell (using a lower-level spell slot can be advantageous), or for armor skin.  <br><br>I'd also consider switching weapon choice from rapier to scimitar (wait until you're a blackguard and have martial proficiency to take focus) - this will let you use the Keen Edge spell from scrolls or as an alternative spell selection.  Rapiers are piercing, so they can't be keened by the spell, but scimitars are slashing and have the same critical hit stats. <br><br>Finally, I'd consider dropping Divine Might, it's a limited uses/day ability that only adds to damage, when what you will really need to increase in your melee offense is AB.  This can free you to take Empower in pre-epic levels in addition to Maximize in epic levels, or to swap Empower with Maximize and get Armor Skin. <br><br>For spell selection:  I'd definitely take Endurance over Eagle's Splendor; there is more variety of +save and +cha equipment in most games than there is of +con equipment, and you will really need the hitpoints.<br><br>I'm not sure I'd bother keeping Mage Armor very long in any but the lowest of low-magic environments, since its AC bonus would end up being overridden once you got magic equipment.  It'll be good for your early levels, though.  I'd probably replace it with Identify to identify scrolls, wands, etc in the field and feed my UMD skill.<br><br>Likewise with Greater Magic Weapon - odds are if you are in an environment that goes to level 40, you'll be finding +5 weapons (or better) before you get enough caster levels to yield the full +5 bonus out of GMW.<br><br>By the time you're able to cast level 4 spells, Stoneskin will probably be worthless for you unless you are slumming (fighting enemies much weaker than yourself).  The enemies you'll be fighting in the epic levels will have weapons with enough +s to bypass it.  I'd replace it with Evard's Black Tentacles (in 1.67 this spell got some serious love and is one of the best friends of spellsword builds now).<br><br>I might also consider dropping Ice Storm in favor of something else - Lesser Spell Breach or Minor Globe of Invulnerability comes to mind, as does Polymorph Self - but this is entirely a matter of taste.  (However, Lesser Spell Breach can free you from taking Greater Spell Breach and opening a level 6 spell slot...)<br><br>For level 9 I'd consider taking Mordekainen's Disjunction instead of Time Stop.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

AB boosters apart from weapons are pretty unusual, aren't they?  And +20 weapons are quite unusual, I'm sure.<br><br>Nevertheless, it's true that it would be nice to raise my BAB.  I'm not sure how to do that, though...I suppose you could go Elf instead of Human, drop a feat (Blind Fight?), take the XP penalty, and end up with more Dex.  Or you could swap four post-epic Rogue levels for the pre-epic Sorcerer ones for +1 BAB, as long as you don't mind that the build wouldn't mature into its concept until epic, and even then wouldn't get skill dumps for Tumble.  That's all I can think of, though, and I'm not sure how worthwhile either one would be.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/07/06 21:42:51 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br>I think your biggest hurdle in this build is your hitpoints, however, or rather the lack thereof.  Particularly in light of how late epic dodge comes into play for your build.  I seriously doubt you will find much success PvPing using a build that has less than 400 unbuffed hitpoints, for that matter.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I agree entirely.  That's why I mentioned PvP in such tentative terms (maybe PvP lite) in the build description:  Outside of a few specialized situations, you're probably going to die if you go up against other players.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/07/06 21:42:51 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br>For feat selection:  I'd consider exchanging maximize spell for empower spell (using a lower-level spell slot can be advantageous), or for armor skin.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I'm pretty happy with the AC on the build already; I think I'd rather have Toughness than Armor Skin, anyway.

Rapiers are piercing, so they can't be keened by the spell, but scimitars are slashing and have the same critical hit stats.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Scimitars don't qualify for Weapon Finesse, so they're out.  I actually forgot that in the first version of this build (never posted), and I spent a while wondering why my AB was so low...my threat range was great, though, because I had Improved Critical in that version, too.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/07/06 21:42:51 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br>Finally, I'd consider dropping Divine Might, it's a limited uses/day ability that only adds to damage, when what you will really need to increase in your melee offense is AB.

Also, since I haven't come up with any good ways to increase AB, it seems to me that it's important to do as much damage as I can when I DO manage to hit something.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/07/06 21:42:51 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br>For spell selection:  I'd definitely take Endurance over Eagle's Splendor; there is more variety of +save and +cha equipment in most games than there is of +con equipment, and you will really need the hitpoints.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Yeah, I guess you're right on this one.  Having a guaranteed +5 to Cha to round out that nasty odd-numbered ability score satisfies my obsessive-compulsive tendencies, but I might just have to let it go.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/07/06 21:42:51 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br>I'm not sure I'd bother keeping Mage Armor very long in any but the lowest of low-magic environments, since its AC bonus would end up being overridden once you got magic equipment.

It's a very good way to get in a few free sneak attacks.  It's really up to the player what spell they pick there.

I've been away a while, I didn't make the connection between your dex build and the rapier.  Hehe.<br><br>For the +20 weapon thing... you're right a lot of medium magic environments won't have them, but they will have +5 (and in some cases +6 or +7) before your GMW maxes out (at sorc level 15).  My expectation of a mid-magic epic game would include the possibility of +10 weapons by character level 40, because +5 is traditionally considered the appropriate weapon strength for level 20 going back to early editions of AD&amp;D pen and paper.<br><br>+12 to a stat really isn't that uncommon, however, and can be done in many games.  It will usually need a combination of gear and potions but such things are widely available in NWN.  Remember that +stat can be stacked from multiple items, so you might have a belt of giant strength +5 and gauntlets of ogre power +3, and then drink a potion of bull's strength and get +2 to +4... and voila you have the full +12 to strength.<br><br>Strength and dex typically get the most item lovin', con, wis, and int tend to get the least.<br><br>In 1.67, Evard's bypasses spell resistance and anti-spell defenses like globe of invulnerability or spell mantle.  All the damage done by tentacles is applied in one hit, even though multiple tentacles roll grapple checks to inflict damage.  This means that unlike IGMS, damage resistance isn't a significant barrier to tentacles.  <br><br>The tentacles attack with a grapple check (based on Str and Size) rather than a to-hit roll - this means that basically the only defense against them is to be big or to have a high strength.  DR, AC, concealment, spell mantles, SR, etc are all useless.<br><br>However Small and Tiny sized creatures are immune.  But you'd have a better chance popping tentacles on an epic level dragon or lich or the like, than you would using IGMS, because IGMS would just bounce off spell resistances.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
