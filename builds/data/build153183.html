I don't mean to sound like a jerk, but this isn't really a "build," in fact it's just tips about your preferences for skills/feats/abilities as a wizard. (perhaps better suited for the new "Class Information" thread?) I'm not saying it's useless, just that I'd probably post it there, not here. It doesn't really offer any new "build" ideas.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

No offense taken. Yes I see your point, but I just wanted to post it so if someone wanted to find a pure wizard. But as you said this forum is for new ideas on builds and any future posts I make won't be about something most people have seen before.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ctasemelka on 09/11/04 16:14</span></i></p>

Not many pure builds posted around here, I like it.  But pure builds asside it might be a good idea to take 1-2 levels of rogue to spent those massive skill points and since you have ok dex the uncanny dodge would be useful(save you 4+ ac when flatfooted).  If you plan to go the auto-still spell route definetly reduce the dex and increase the strength since the dex won't help and you need to be able to carry that equipment.

The rougue lvls would be very good power gaming wise, but I made this build a moderate, it is still rp friendly but can compete with the best due to powergaming. And as you pointed out if auto still spell (IMO the most useful auto metamagic feat) was taken I could definatly boost strength. (Which is why you probably shouldn't be a gnome if you want to be a wizard that takes auto still.)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ctasemelka on 09/12/04 22:35</span></i></p>
