Arena of Champions:<br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1110207432000.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br><br>Anyone care to comment on it? <br><br>I have played the deathmatch against the Death Wyrm. Died both times. I also found the item selection very limited. My Woodsman had no hand axes (which he specializes in)... <br><br>If you have tried it out, please let me know how you rate it as a "build tester".

Just tried it with no items at all I managed the Death Wyrm, but the Balrok Lord (I think that was the name) I could hardly make a dent in.

I used the Druid one I posted in the builds page, as I said he was completely naked no items/potions or anything, obviously that testing mod is supposed to be played with items since the monsters are very tough.<br><br>EDIT: I cast 3 spells on him before the fight - Owls insight, True Seeing and Spell Resistance. I think I shifted into dragon shape though when I was low on HP (I already forgot).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MartinJHolm on 03/28/05 13:34</span></i></p>
