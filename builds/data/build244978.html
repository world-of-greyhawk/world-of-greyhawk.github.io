The Buff of the Jungle is a buffering shifter specialized in Improved Elemental forms, he has all Druid and Cleric spells, with reasonable resistance to Dispels, he actually has so many buffs that a single Mords won't take them out, probably not even 2, he works best in low to mid magical environments, perm-haste armor would be perfect, but that's quite it, much higher items than that could be a problem.<br><br>The base idea is to use Divine Might and Divine Shield while shifted, but a dragon requires too much WIS investment to make it worthwile and a shifter couldn't get Monk in the recipe, which gives lots of power. In any case, the Buff of the Jungle shifted in Improved Earth Elemental form with Divine Might actually deals more damage than a fully buffed dragon (considering that Buff of the Jungle takes whatever cleric or druid buffs the dragon took), although his AB and AC won't be as good, still, pretty decent IMO.<br><br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br><br>PvM and PvP<br><br>Alignment: Lawful Neutral<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Status:<br>STR 13<br>DEX 8<br>CON 8<br>WIS 16 (20)<br>INT 13<br>CHA 16 (26)<br><br>1 Druid1 - Blind-Fight, Knockdown<br>2 Druid2<br>3 Druid3 - Power Attack<br>4 Druid4 - WIS +1 (17)<br>5 Druid5<br>6 Monk1 - Extend Spell<br>7 Cleric1 - Domains: Trickery and Travel<br>8 Cleric2 - WIS +1 (18)<br>9 Cleric3 - Divine Might<br>10 Druid6<br>11 Druid7<br>12 Cleric4 - WIS +1 (19), Divine Shield<br>13 Druid8<br>14 Druid9<br>15 Druid10 - Empower Spell<br>16 Druid11 - WIS +1 (20)<br>17 Druid12<br>18 Druid13 - Improved Critical: unarmed<br>19 Druid14<br>20 Druid15 - CHA +1 (17)<br>21 Druid16 - Weapon Finesse<br>22 Druid17<br>23 Druid18<br>24 Druid19 - CHA +1 (18), Epic Prowess<br>25 Druid20<br>26 Cleric5<br>27 Cleric6 - Armor Skin<br>28 Cleric7 - CHA +1 (19)<br>29 Cleric8<br>30 Cleric9 - Great CHA I (20)<br>31 Cleric10<br>32 Cleric11 - CHA +1(21)<br>33 Cleric12 - Great CHA II (22)<br>34 Cleric13<br>35 Cleric14<br>36 Cleric15 - CHA +1 (23), Great CHA III (24)<br>37 Cleric16<br>38 Cleric17<br>39 Cleric18 - Great CHA IV (25)<br>40 Monk2 - CHA +1 (26)<br><br>20% XP penalty starting at level 9<br><br>Travel taken in case there isn't perm-haste armor, as he is intended for low magical worlds, but that can be changed depending on the setting.<br><br>Skillpoints: 203<br>Discipline: 43<br>Concentration: 40<br>Listen: 40<br>Spellcraft: 40<br>Tumble: 40<br><br>HP: 280<br>AC: 24 (10 base -1 DEX, +5 WIS, +8 Tumble, +2 Armor Skin)<br>BAB: 24<br>AB: +26/+23/+20/+17/+14<br><br>As a small variant, you could take Monk until the end as a level 40 build and gain 1 AB.<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude: 25<br>Reflex: 14<br>Will: 31<br><br>Spells (I-X):<br>Druid: 6/7/6/6/6/6/4/4/4/4<br>Cleric: 6/7/6/6/6/5/4/3/3/2<br>Monk: Almost <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>I won't write all the buffs he uses, all Cleric and Druid spells are available anyway, I'm sure he can cap WIS, STR and AB, with also several bonuses to AC, damage and all stats.<br>I don't like much short-term buffs (1 round/level or less), specially since I have to buff and then shift, but Divine Power, for example, would prove most useful giving 1 APR and +6 AB, and luckily Divine Might and Shield can be casted while shifted several times per day.<br><br>His main disadvantage is that he relies on buffs almost completely, unbuffed he's nothing special, although he has large amounts of buffs, he can still make some offensive spells, but don't expect powerful Implosion DC's, more like Creeping Doom, Firestorm, Storm of Vengeance or Harm, he has huge healing and good summoning capabilities, damage is very good, and he should be quite powerful in any low magical server.<br><br>-I'm not really sure how much Improved Elemental forms can breach DRs, if any...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 06/25/06 00:30</span></i></p>

It's a very valid variant, since I have Divine Might for damage... but... I like big damages... anyway, it could get its uses from time to time, but, instead of what, IKD?

Yes you can, you only need to fill the pre-requisites beforehand with a caster class, I don't remember exactly, but for Extended spell I think you only need to be able to cast level 2 spells or something like that, which is attained with 5 Druid levels.<br><br>Lack of comments on the build BTW...
