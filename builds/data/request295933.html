Looking for a good monk, that dual weilds Kama"s with decent AB and AC, I play on very high magic server, can build socketed weapon up to +20. AC enhancing items are available thru a socket system. Have considered Monk/ Ranger/Rouge or Monk/fighter/WM. Not sure which, or maybe there is something better out there. Open to any suggestions. Thanks

Oh man, now you're taking my language.  I love dual kamas, hehe.  Dex based is the way to with dual kamas, for the most part, methinks.  If I mention any ab/ac numbers, I'm assuming +5 weps and +12 ability capped gear.<br><br>20 10 10 Pal Monk Rogue dual kama.  Dex based with Divine shield if you can get +12 ability gear, sans Divine shield if not.  61ish+ constant dual wield ab, and... wait for it... Holy Sword!<br><br>20 19 1 Monk Bg Sor.  Dex based, Divine Shield can push ac to 81, true strike ab to 66.<br><br>15 13 12 Monk Bg Sor.  Similar to above, but with True Seeing, and silent spell for heaps of True Strikes.  Breach/Horn, mantles, et al.<br><br>21 18 1 - Ranger Monk Wiz.  Classic dual wield build that pushes true striked ab to 71 vs favored enemies, and ac to 73.  Bane of enemies adds some nice damage, and str-based is not at all out of the question with this build, as it can really hurt things with the extra damage and high apr.  Empty Body + Invis Purge makes for some real fun, too.  Need I mention epic traps, and corner sneaking, too?<br><br>9 10 21 Monk CoT Wiz, elf.  I posted a halfling dual kukri version awhile back, but an elf with kamas works nice too.  Very good ac with Epic Mage Armor, around 77, and true striked ab around 65.  And who doesn't to mords their opponents now and again, too?<br><br>Monk 20 WM 19 Wiz 1.  Seriously painful crits, and excellent ab.  Probably have to go human to have enough feats for 4 Wm pre-epic, and therefore 16ab pre-epic.<br><br>Monk 18 Pal 18 Sor 4.  More of the Holy Sword action, excellent ab again with silent spell and heaps of true strikes.<br><br>Monk 20 Rogue 19 Wiz (or Sdd) 1.  Epic dodge, crippling strike, traps, ouch!<br><br>Monk 21 Wizard 3 Pm 16.  Dual kama pm monk!  Hard to kill, but hardly a killer!<br><br>Cleric 26 CoT 8 Monk 6.  Another classic dual kama.  Who hasn't made one of these yet?  Ask me nicely and I might even go to your server and make one for you, since everyone should have one of these.  Around 58-63 constant dual wield ab with wrath/war domain.  Pain in the butt to kill with tons of heals, too.<br><br>Monk 15 Cleric 15 CoT 10.  Easy dispel, but sick ab with wrath, war domain, and cleric buffs.<br><br>Cleric 26 Bg 4 Monk 10.  Kinda bland, but similar ab to to the 26 8 6 above, and more monk speed is always nice, right?<br><br>And I could probably think of a ton more if I weren't tired right now.  Any of those look appealing at all?

Actually, since he can have +20 weapons, then cleric and Wizard builds built around AB-buffing and true strikes are useless. cleric still holds merit of course, and wizard too, for protection etc. Paladins Holy Sword will still be nice though. But on a world like this, I'd really think Epic dodge would be it. Combining WM and Epic dodge would be superb in theory, but feat starved. Not many other ways too boost AB with +20 weapons though. Kails build would possibly be the best still, since if you're a dexer Halfling you can't access WM until you're lvl 18, and then you're already at -5 AB.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Thanks for all your suggestions, Kal's Monastic Commando looks really good. I saw it when I was scrolling through<br>the chac build guide, not sure why I passed it. After looking at it again I really think this will work.<br><br>Kal the reason you took monk 11 I believe was for the Posion immunity according to the write up on the Chac.<br><br>Hiwatt<br>Thanks for all the different combo's.  They sound really interesting.<br><br>Grim, thanks also for your input. <br><br>I invite all of you to try the server I play on Trials of NewCastle, under the roleplay section.<br>Cheers, <br>Scott
