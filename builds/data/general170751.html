I want to build a cleric that is mainly casting but with zen archery so good at ranged as well. I was wondering which way I should go either:<br><br>1) pure cleric wear full plate, tower shield and sling or just bow/ crossbow. (will have trouble carrying all that stuff so it might need 12 strength)<br><br>2) Add some levels of monk in so there is not need for full plate and just use crossbow/bow but i'm not sure how many i would need or how to distibute them (maybe first two levels monk and very last level monk)<br><br>Any advice would be great <br>Thanks, CS

As for building a pure level 40 Cleric, a strength of 8 really wouldnt hurt you too badly since you will probably be taking maximize spell and extend spell. You will more than make up for the low str with a max or empowered bull's str. <br><br>If you are going to go with a monk/cleric combo, I would take 9 levels of monk. You will gain a lot of helpful feats:<br>1: Evasion<br>   Flurry of Blows<br>   Improved Unarmed Strike (in case they disarm that bow)<br>   Monk AC Bonus (since you will have crazy Wisdom)<br>   Stunning Fist <br>2: Deflect Arrows (well duh)<br>3: Monk Speed (its nice to be a little bit faster)<br>   Still Mind (+2 against mind spells, big deal)<br>5: Purity of Body(bye bye disease)<br>6: Knockdown<br>   Improved Knockdown (raise that discipline, its worth it)<br>7: Wholeness of Body<br>9: Improved Evasion (wonderful against spells and traps just make sure you have some dex (maximize or empowered spell again))<br><br>Yes I would take a monk level 1st and last. This way you will always have your ac bonus, and at the end you can max tumble and discipline.<br><br>Its up to you, a little more offense/defense vs. caster level and DC.<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership. We live in harmony we do, well at least until he gets hungry and swallows a companion or two.<br><br>-Solstice on living with a symbiote link(Entropy).

The best part about an epic cleric are the benifits you get in the low level spells.  Almost all of them give you some 1dx bonus per 1, 2, 3, etc. caster levels giving you the ability to maximize your AC and attack.  For this focus on uping your wisdom.  Every chance you get boost your wisdom score so that you get the most out of your cleric.  All you will need to do is pick up ring of protection (Deflection bonus +4) and a light armor say leather or banded mail (AC Bonus +4)  This will bump your AC over 20 and if you pick up a periphat of wisdom +3, 4, 5 your wisdom score could jump to above thirty.  Study the low level spells and you will see that you have spells like entropic shield and and Divine power.  Use Magic circle against alignment and you get a plus 2 bonus to AC and enemies get -2 penalty to attack making it a total of 4.  As you see where I am going you can ultimately make you cleric unbeatable.  And with area effects like earthquake you can do an extreme ammount of damage as well as knock down your enemies and also stun them for some time.  This can make being surrounded a lot less difficult.  And when you use the summoning spells like planar ally or create greater undead you can bring a powerful ally to your side that is pretty much immune to almost any magic.  And they also bring with them some benifits like fear and the like.  You also have great spells like regeneration (6 hit points per round) lasting 1 round per level that can make you almost invincible.  I could go on describing the spells but really all you have to do is study them a little and pick what is best for your fighting style (melee or ranged) and you can customize you cleric to be a great healer and dealer of death.  Plus at level 40 you will almost certainly destroy most undead every time you try to turn them.  Bottom line, if you are an epic cleric you have no need for plate mail or multi classing (nothing against monks) to get the most out of your character.  By far the cleric is probably the most underappreciated character class.  And if you are a Dwarf or elf you get those great bonuses to either constitution or dex which help out later.  Just choose the recommended each time you level up to 20 then you can start picking what feats and skills you want to increase then.  Also recommend using the Healing Domain (learn heal 1 level earlier so you have 2 levels of heal) and either Death or knowledge or magic for the other domain.  I know I have rambled but I love playing clerics both in NWN and paper D&amp;D because like wizards once they are level 10 or 11 they can be very destructive.  Good luck  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">
