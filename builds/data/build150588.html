How powerful is your epic fiend with that many BG levels? I ave never found it all that powerful. It is a nice damage sink for pvm, but it is not a real threat as far as damage dealing. My experiences with it, however, haven't been on a build with that many BG levels.<br><br>Also, why is there 6 druid levels? You could get a few more hitpoints with another BG level. You may also want to check, but I think undead shape can be taken if you are just an epic character, and not an epic shifter like the book states. You could then go 5 druid/10 shifter/25 BG and take another feat. Undead shape does require greater wildshape IV, so you may be able to take it at level 10 shifter if you take that level on a feat level.<br><br>Looks like a fun build though.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I think that he took 6th druid level to get 40 ranks in Spellcraft.

I took the extra levels in shifter and druid for playability. I also did take my Undead shape on shifter level 10 which is at level 27. You could loose the one level from shifter to get undead shape later and replace it with black guard. And yes i took the  druid to max out spell craft at 40.<br><br>The Epic vrok at a lvl 23 Black Guard has 285 points. He doesn't have much attack power either. I more or less use it as a meatsheild which helps against annoying IGMS.  The Vrock will be able to take a few of them before dying himself.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By XyberKnight on 08/29/04 22:26</span></i></p>

Gotcha. I offered the level split for the feat boost, but I can understand the spellcraft needs as well.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

No problem i thought about the extra feat but it was hard to pass up maxing spellcraft<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By XyberKnight on 08/30/04 03:50</span></i></p>

Improve crit (sythe) never seems to work when I am shifted into a Risen Lord, it doesn't appear on my character sheet, and when I roll a 17 on attack I never critical either.  Is it just me?

Actually it does a normal sythe has a range of 20x3 with the improved critical it will be 19-20x3. It may not seem like much of a diff but find a keen edge too and it will be 18-20x3.
