Looking for a cleric build but for rp purposes would want to focus on cleric mixed in with some other classes to survive better but definitely have all the cleric abilities. I'm going to start playing on a high-magic server (at least I think it is) so not sure how that would change the build. Do you have to focus more on spellcasting on a high magic world to keep up with fighters? Or is it the other way around?<br><br>Thanks
