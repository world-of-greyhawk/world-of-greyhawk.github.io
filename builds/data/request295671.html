Any unique double sided weapon (double axe/twobladed sword,etc) out there? level 20 or level 40. Ive always liked the double weapons, but the lack of ability to fully function with a shield hampers their defensive capabilities.

I have this build <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "255947", "", ".", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> It was one of my first builds and it was fun/easy to play. Its probably not the most powerful double-sided based build out there. I know some people dont like to take Monk without using kamas or taking advantage of the Monk speed but I think all of the "free feats" Monk brings to the build, especially a build with Weapon Master in it, is worth it as well as being able to put 40 points in to Tumble as a class skill. The AC wont be much of a problem PvM. PvP is another story though.<br><br>Anyways, if you decide to use it, use the 2nd version of the build posted there as it was tweaked using suggestions of other members. Or, maybe another member on here will be able to lead you to something better.

Something like a Monk 15 CoT 14 Wiz 11 works well too.  Should have plenty of monk speed and AC bonuses, CoT for bonus feats and saves, and Wiz for heaps of True Strikes and Horns, some True Seeing, Imp Invis, Mage Armor+Shadow Con. Mage Armor, Breach, et al.  Probably can't fit enough Cha to make much, if any use of Divine Wrath, I suppose, but with Monk speed and 10+ True Strikes, you should be ok <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br><br>Go monk 14 CoT 6 pre-epic, and you've still got 3 Epic bonus feats for AS, EWF, and EP.  Frees up room for ESF: Disc, and a few Great Str feats.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Hiwatt on 04/23/08 16:18</span></i></p>
