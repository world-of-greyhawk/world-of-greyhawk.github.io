<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM or PvP Build</b><br><br>I made this build for a character who is a healer cleric and a captain in the dwarven army on the server i play him. It's a true warpriest, with good healing capability and a quite good at melee. And somewhat sturdy to. This build is a good PvP and very good PvM build. It is for a dev crit banned server, but that can be worked into the build, if you like. Warpriest gets a nice AB, and very nice AB with buffs plus a little DR(15) to keep him alive longer. War and Heal domains to get Heal spell on two different caster levs, plus the nice buff with war.

You might want to start with 15 str and 13 dex. Raise str at lvl 4 and you gain one point to put into cha/int.

Looks like a good, solid Cleric/DD build. And I, like Cinnabar Din, like seeing non-Dev Crit builds. Some thoughts:<br><br>Why CoT instead of Fighter? Dwarf gets fighter as favored class so you wouldn't get an experience penalty. Fighter would permit you to take Weapon Spec and Epic Weapon Spec. Albeit you would lose the +2 to saves the CoT brings. But I think Fighter would complement the other two classes best.<br><br>I wouldn't take Power Attack without going for Cleave (and I probably wouldn't take Cleave in this build unless I were going for Dev. Crit). With your clerical buffs you probably don't need the boost that Power Attack brings, but you could always use Knockdown. I always like to have Improved Knockdown in my melee characters.<br><br>Would you benefit by raising Wisdom a bit for extra spells per day? Perhaps drop a Great Strength or two to leave Strength at 30 and raise Wisdom?<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

The CoT levs are just to get Great wisdom. I wondered about doing fighter, to get extra damage, even take two pre epic to gain 1 more BAB, and i will switch power attack for KD, thank you. Hm, two less Gr.STR for two wis, and drop CoT and get two fighter levs pre epic and two epic will make the build even better, no loss of AB(unbuffed), and 6 gain to damage. Never thought of that. Thank you. Only thing is that on my server there are a lot of immune to KD items. I also forgot to add in Def stance, so add 1 AB and damage and 80 hp's to that above. God, I'm sloppy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/22/05 20:04</span></i></p>

A minor benefit, but a minor sacrifice, too.

Really like this build Grimnir.

Glad you like it. It's my first build for these pages ever, and I made a few mistakes. I will clarify. I play this on a PW, and has played it a lot. I use Morning Star for faction reasons so I never knew about that, but thought warhammer was a Cleric weapon to, sorry about that. Your suggestions make Warhammer possible tho.<br><br>Saves. A mistake i only did this time, I knew about it, but never bothered to post when i found out. I read numbers from the character database, and not from the actual sheet in a mod. The numbers are off then.<br><br>Stats&gt; He is short on skillpoints. Tumble would help his AC. I use spellcraft for counterspells, didn't know about the save thing back then, lol.<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 12<br>CON 16<br>WIS 15<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6 This would net you the skill-points with a loss of 1 to AB and dmg. How you managed only 14 WIS is beyond me, your other stats are the same as these. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  <br><br>AB, no clue as to how I managed to miss 1 point, since I read from the sheet. But it is 42, it says so now. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Divine wrath. Yes, this is useless. You need at least CHA 10 for it to be activated.<br><br>War domain. Almost useless to. Take Trickery instead. Keep Healing domain, tho, it is a life saver.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 10/24/05 18:19</span></i></p>
