Swift, silent, and adaptable; capable of dealing fatal damage with any number of weapons.  A true ninja warrior that uses the shadows and his stealth skills to such good affect that even in the light of day nobody sees more than a blurred shape.  To his chosen victim, it seems that a piece of darkness itself, a splinter of shadow, has come to kill him. . .<br><br><br>The "Splinter of Shadow"<br>Elven 19/4/17 Rogue/Ninja Spy/Man At Arms<br><br>Str 13<br>Dex 20 (32)<br>Con 10<br>Wis 8<br>Int 13<br>Cha 8<br><br>Ability Summary<br>-----------------------<br>Sneak is 11d6 (10 Rogue, 1 Ninja)<br>Improved Knockdown<br>Superior Initiative<br>HIPS<br>Epic Dodge<br>Self-Conceal5<br>WF and ImpCrit in ShortBow and Kukri<br>WF, EWF, and ImpCrit in Rapier and Mace<br>Strike at the Core - All weapons used have a DC27 Con Drain<br>Furious Assult (extra attack/round)<br>Focussed Strike - Adds Dex Bonus to damage when using Power Attack.

Sadly, the build is weaker than I hoped in the early going, thanks to the significant pre-reqs of ManAtArms, and desiring 4 attacks/round; it forced Weapon Finesse back too late in the build for me to call it a truly good build from level 1.  However, once you get HIPS at level 11, you are dealing ranged sneak damage at will, and the rest of the trip to Weapon Finesse is a piece of cake.  And once you have Finesse. . . you are awesome.<br><br>I also would have liked to be able to squeeze in Expertise; but I saw no way with Self-Conceal.  <br><br>Here is an alternative approach to the build that also works; intended for people who consider Self-Conceal to costly:<br>Replace ManAtArms levels from 26-32 with Ninja Spy, thus ending at 19/10/11 Rogue/Ninja/MaA.  This does the following:<br><br>- Gives you Imp Invisibility via Ninja Level 10; giving you some Self-Conceal. This frees up 5 feat slots; 2 epic, and 3 Rogue bonus feats.<br>- Gets 2 more Sneak attacks, Slippery Mind, and the really neat "Mask of a Thousand Faces"; something every RP assassin type would enjoy.<br>- Alas, you also lose 2 ManAtArms feats from the build.  <br><br>Pros<br>------<br>- Very high damage for a Dex build.<br>- Versatile; can always use the weapon appropriate for the job, and deal good damage in the process (not countng the sneak).<br>- Mega-stealth, with high initiative, ImpKnockdown, and excellent sneak damage. <br>- The extra attacks (Furious Assult) and auto-weapon Con drain are definite plusses.<br><br>Cons<br>-------<br>- Has decent AC with all that Dex, but not exceptional (still grumpy about not getting Expertise). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>- Could use some help in Fort/Will save area. Slippery Mind would have helped (see alternative build), and the UMD can be used to help this as well.<br>- Haste item highly desired (as usual).<br><br>Constructive comments welcome.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .

Hmm that sounds liek a fubared 2da file then, because even the pnp epic handbook states it needs 30 tumble.<br><br>I did look at weap finesse and sure enough mace is on there though. That's kind of nice to know. I've been trying to look at a blunt sneak attack build.<br><br>/ed ROFL I just looked at the feat.2da file and sure enough no min skill requirement. Looks like the game is wrong in this instance instead of the manual.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 08/22/04 14:53</span></i></p>

Ahh didn't know about the power attack prereq. I knew it had 4 weapon focus prereq.

I was talking with Georg Zoeller about getting epic dodge's tumble prerreq fixed in 1.64. At first he said he was going to get it in, but he later said there may be to many characters becoming invalid if they did patch it in. I can definately understand not wanting that. I guess the no rank prereq is here to stay.

Even one of the first epic builds would become illegal. The Rogue Archer takes epic dodge earlier than level 27.<br><br>Syrath
