Hey all, was looking for a pretty nice half-orc melee build, preferably one that would use a great axe. There's a build by Avendesora84 that would be perfectly fine, and I've used it in the past but I'm not quite sure how to shift things around so it'd work with a half-orc instead of a human.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "191493", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Halp me? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>Ze'ev Thorne-White haired ex-Madman Blademaster, Gaidin<br>Maddox Donnor-Everyone's favorite ex-miner madman<br>Oh, and I'm a DM</i>

The thing with Horcs is that stats.  You are down Intelligence AND charisma.  Int for this build is the kicker.  The best way is to loose CON.  <br><br>With a H-orc, you get +2 str so your start would be 18.  The thing I ALWAYS do with H-orcs is to get Dev Crit at lv 24 at the latest.  <br><br>It took me about 5 years to be confident in my building enough to take the half orc seriously as a class.  Once i did, it is THE class for non-casters (i LOVED half orc clerics, btw).  You really got to grow to get the most out of halfers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 09/30/09 03:13</span></i></p>

Magic you didn't quite post the AC, which is what worries me. Using a 2 handed weapon and I don't want to be so out of the AC game that a rat can come up and hit me every time.<br><br>What I've done is dropped Con, minimized charisma and added 1 point to Dex so i've got 18 str, 14 dex, 14 con, 13 int, 8 wis, and 6 charisma. I get the feeling the extra point in the dex modifier might come in handy if I can ever get enough wis gear to get up to the point where I can wear cloth and have the same AC as plate.<br><br>That, however, is an RP problem.<br>_________________<br><i>Ze'ev Thorne-White haired ex-Madman Blademaster, Gaidin<br>Maddox Donnor-Everyone's favorite ex-miner madman<br>Oh, and I'm a DM</i>

Dex 14 gives you +2 to ac, so your ac will be a HUGE 12!  with +8 from tumble, 20!!!  AND you have NOTHING else to buff your AC with (ie spells).  If your INTENT was to use monk to get wisdom modifier on ac, NO WAY!!!  That is possibly the worst choice you could EVER do.<br><br>Why?  Lets say, for argument sake, you find +12 to wisdom.  THat means now you have +5 to ac.  With dex, you are +7, which is lower than Full Plate +0 at +8!  So, by making a silly choice, you are even weaker than when you thought you started.<br><br>Here's an even BETTER suggestion!  Take Divine Shiled too to REALLY pump AC (which every two hand weilder NEEDS)!  That way you can focus on, not 1, not 2 (which is the most i would really consider), not 3 but 4 DIFFERENT sTATS!  What you end up with will be something just above a kobald, BUT you will have Dev crit.<br><br>Now, back to a more serious topic.  Monk is bad for what you are trying to do.  THE BEST choice is to take SD for Tumble dumps, vs monk.  You have the feats for WM.  That way you wont suffer ANY penalty.  You would get HIPS, and take it to 2 max lvls for dumps.  This way, you can focus ONLY on str and not worry about dex, wisdom and charisma (jk)!  Then you could take WM to 28 for  +2 ab nd 2 WM bonus feats (2 tepid toughness would add 40 hp).  <br><br>With this route, now you have a horc that will be alot more effective at what you want it to do, imho.  But then again, what do i know<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

If, for some insane reason (insane cuz i cant imagine how much +dex you can have, but on most pws, you dont get +12 to a stat on one item, so you would be sacrificing for +12 to dex) you DID get +12 to dex, that would put you at 26dex.  16/2 (26-10=16) is +8, which is what Plate mail is!  That is PLATE +0!!  BUT, you now have dex maxing gear on which means you DONT have other things that would be important (what those are is VERY gear dependant, and can vary enormously).  It isnt a smart thing.   Now, consider +12 to wisdom, which is 20 pr +5, now with ALL those gear slots taken, you have Full Plate +5.  hmm... Since you ARNT using kama, WHY use monk?  LOL  Like magi sais, rogue is a better choice than monk.

Kial, i agree with using monk with non-traditional roles (ie, not using kama or fists).  Infact, i did one a few years ago, posted on this guild.  THe issue here though seems to be the misguided drive to gain AC through Wisdom on a Half Orc Weapon Master build, which we all know is stat short to begin with.  Of course, you could always short on the strength, but then, why use Half Orc?  Shorting on strength is better suited to Halfling (the other Halfs).<br><br>See, the thing with half orcs is, they are really an advanced race to use.  By this i mean, they require ALOT of thought beforehand and some deep understandings of the mechanics to make them really useable to how you want to use them.  In the end, unless we are you, we cant really build the perfect halfer for you cuz we dont know how you like to play. All of this is just banter in cyberspace, guessing at what you want.  To be fair, the only thing the OT says is "This build, i like with Half orc!! make or kill you!!" (the limits of my rp <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ).
