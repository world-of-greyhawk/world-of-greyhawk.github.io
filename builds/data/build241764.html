This allows him more flexibility with his spell book management, and will also allow him to cast those 6th level spells as if they were Stilled.  Say hello to Dirge and Ice Storms that can be cast at your Bard level while wearing armor and shield.  Other spells worthy of scribing are Wounding Whispers, See Invisibility, Keen Edge, etc., which will allow more Stilled/Extended versions of Bulls/Cats/Eagles, etc.<br><br><b>Side Note 2</b>:  Also, this character never achieves high enough Perform naturally to sing a 29th level Bard Song.  Without items, the best he can manage is a 21st level Song, followed by a 23rd level Curse.  He/she will need some augmentation to achieve a 75 Perform to pull out the +6AC, +14 all skills.  At 58 without items, one will only need to find 17 more skill points.<br><br><b>Side Note 3</b>: In addition, only 1 Harper level is taken.  This is to get Lasting Inspiration as soon as possible, while yet still maintaining General Epic Feat conservation.  Taking the other 4 Harper levels didn't really add anything to the build, while 4 more Bard levels added an extra feat, longer spell durations and a potentially better battle speech.  I saw little interest in the stacking Cats or Eagles, nor in the potion crafting or Invisibility, or in the Save gimmicks.  The Bard already does all these things well enough.  <br><br><b>Side Note 4</b>: Crafting Skills have been selected due to many PWs using CEP, and it's always fun to customize your characters.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 16:10</span></i></p>

Solid epic bard build... the perform requirements do get quite out of hand for the bard song, though I suppose a charisma-centric bard would be able to keep up with them.  <br><br>Your saves against non-magic special attacks look a little worrisome.  Spells should be more than okay because of your spellcraft bonus however.<br><br>I wonder if you can counterspell normally in armor, I have read posts that said you can still fight while in counterspell mode (strangely).  That might be a very interesting tactic for our plate-wearing buff-centric bards.  I'll have to test it when I'm done spreading chaos on yon forums.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Curious use of the HS, never thought of it, weird though, since you're using two feats to gain one, HS 2 is nice, but you'd lose a feat from either Bard or Fighter, so I stand that it's an ok desition.<br><br>Sure, pretty solid, I just don't like longswords..... but a great build.

Well I tried to test counterspelling in armor while fighting and it didn't seem to do anything... I activated counterspell mode after clicking a target to attack, and it didn't stop attacking, but I also didn't notice any spells being countered and no counterspell rolls were made in the combat log.<br><br>It wasn't an exhaustive test but I'm gonna guess it doesn't work.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Well since you can't cast level 6 spells in heavy armor, and the two level 6 spells you'll want to cast most often are Dirge and Ice Storm - ie, not buffs - I doubt enabling them is a high priority for this build.  I can see leaving them till later.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

In order to achieve 30 Str, six general feats had to be reserved for Great Strengths, leaving only room from Bard/Harper bonus feats to raise Charisma.  Harper1 has to be LI, and Bard23 has to be ESF: Perform.  I wish it were otherwise.  If somebody can find a more workable solution, I'm all ears.  There might be room to reconfigure since EWF was taken on a General Feat level.

Interesting build, typically when one sees so many bard levels one sees a dex based build as opposed to strength. Though, when one considers the lack of offense in the bard spell book, you proabably don't need to cast too many spells in combat anyway so casting stilled is fine.  The build looks solid, though you could take 4 more fighter levels pre-epic to take IKD and improved critical at the cost of two great strengths (same ab, -1 damage which should balance out with the extra crits).  It might delay the development of your bard skills a bit, but it would improve your fighting skills at lower levels.<br><br>I understand how you feel about the story.  I've been working on one recently, Harpers are damn difficult to write around.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I intentionally foreclosed on Improved Crit because of Keen Edge.  It more or less replaces the feat, and a 17-20 crit range with a longsword is right about where you want it.  Those who have ACs lower than that to make a 15-20 range useful are either immune to crits,(undead) or are going to die in 1-2 swings anyway.<br><br>And as you mentioned, taking more Ftr levels does delay the Bard maturation, but I don't think that adding more fighter levels makes him a better fighter.  I think frontloading Bard levels makes him a better fighter.  He is able to get max return on GMW pre-epic, more spells with which to buff himself, and he has the best Bard/Curse Song available in pre-epic. <br><br>I think Samphus found the one thing that still bothers me, though, and that is that last Charisma point and how to take it earlier.  For whatever reason, I now have a mental block and can no longer look at it logically.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

It should also be noted that with Lasting Inspiration on both bard and Curse Song, his skills will all be at least +12 while opponents will all be at least -12 and beyond.  That is why, with the exception of Perform, it pretty much doesn't make any sense to take ESF in anything.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
