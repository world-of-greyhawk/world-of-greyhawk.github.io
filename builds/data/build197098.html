I think it would be easier at low if you could at least start wielding some martial finesseable weapons well early on, and then switch to kukris at level 6.

As long as you start with Rogue, you can't take Exotic Weapon Proficiency.  Or Finesse, or Focus.  These are problems, especially if you plan to play this character first level through a Module.  Modules are often not as friendly as OCs, and there's less room for "down the road".<br><br>I think you would have to rely on using missile fire and smart Rogue tactics to survive 1st level.  Eye of the Beholder is a good testing ground for this...<br><br>I like it, however.  You have 10 Favored's, Bane, an awesome threat range, good AB, decent AC.  I like it better than the Dev Crit versions of Ranger.  Well done.<br><br>However, the Will save is pitiful.  And no slippery Mind.  Also, 30 levels of Ranger with an 8 Wisdom.  You may want to think about Elf or Halfling and replace Rogue with Shadowdancere of Elf.  Or keep it if Halfling.  But you could use the boost.  Going Elf might not be a bad option.  It's actually quite useful to be able to buff your own Animal Companion with Magic Fang and Cat's Grace, and Greater Fang.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 05/29/05 01:39</span></i></p>

Well, that only eliminates the 1st of the three options then.  Then I'd take finesse at 3rd, exotic at 6th, weapon focus at 9th.

OK, i switched Finess to lvl 3, your right ofcourse, dont know what i was thinking <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  <br><br>I also like rangers (of this veriety) because they can wield almost any weapon with great efficiency. It doesn't matter much who they face, they will always have a good AB, and they will have great damage against the FEs. so this guy can wield a bow or a mace and shield or what not, and still do good damage to 10 racial groups. not too bad.<br><br><br>As for the race and so forth, If you look at the feat list, only human with a rogue as starting lvl could have pulled off this feat selection and stats choice.<br>I know that a lvl 30 ranger will have a pretty powerful companion (lvl 24 i think) but still, its not worth the stat points when this guy has UMD and can just cast elemental swarm or some other lvl 9 summon (if available).<br><br>thnks<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 05/29/05 06:09</span></i></p>

It would probably have been better to have gone halfling (+1 to AC, AB and all saves and 4 extra attribute points in return for a feat and an extra skill point per level).

It will give you a +3 AB boost.  That's much more useful than the ability to use exotic weapons at level 3.  If you stay medium, a hand axe will probably be your best weapon, and you don't need an exotic weapon proficiency to use it.  The higher multiplier will probably get you more mileage than a high threat range, especially with only Bane and FE for a damage bonus.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>33) Ranger 24 - Greater Dex I<br><br>34) Ranger 25 - FE_6<br><br>35) Ranger 26 - FE_7, FE_8<br><br>36) Ranger 27 - Greater Dex II<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>How do get two favored enemies at level 35?  You don't get FE as a regular feat and you only get 1 Ranger Bonus feat.  Also you can drop the two Great Dex feats for an epic prowess and someting else like knockdown (this isn't a high damage build and the ability to keep an opponent out the fight while you pound on him could be useful, plus you can add your 2D6 sneak attack) toughness, or an epic save feat, in return for 1 AC and 1 off your reflex save.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>37) Rogue 3 - Max Tumble and UMD at 40<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>UMD works in 5 level intervals, so you either want a UMD of 41 (40 with cha penalty) or 36.<br><br>I'm not sure if you get anything from the WM levels, you have to burn most of your feats to meet the prerequisites and if you had put the extra levels into rogue you probably could have picked up epic dodge.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 05/29/05 06:25</span></i></p>
