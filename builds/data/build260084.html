How about going Druid 8/Shifter 8/WM 4 pre-epic? You'd get 4 attacks per round and some better spells.<br><br>Your final level would be Druid 9/Shifter 15/WM 16.<br><br>Not sure about your AB... <br>+1 (for having a BAB of 16 @ 20th level)<br>-1 (or 2?) from 3 less WM levels.

3 less WM-levels is one less AB, so he'll stay the same with 4 attacks.<br><br>What's the point of raising INT?

Great Fortitude is not a prereq for Epic Fortitude. Take Epic Fortitude first.<br><br>No need to max both spot and listen. Just put points in one. I also think you shouldn't pump up Int. However since the Drider overwrites Str, Dex, and Con your choices are greatly limited. Here are some suggestions...<br><br>Wis - Couple more castings per level never hurt anyone.<br>Str - You'll have a hard time getting to 5th level, (Bear form) little more strength will help.<br>Con - Get it to 21, drop a few Epic Energy Resists and pick up three Epic Damage Risists. (Even though Con get overwritten you'll still have the EDR when you shift.)

Lesser of the evils.  As a Drider, STR/DEX/CON get changed on me.  That leaves me Wis and Int as avenues to dump stat points.  I'm only going to cast lvl 3 Druid Spells so I don't need tons of Wisdom (yes it will increase WILL saves), but I thought that having more skills would help out more.  Tons of Animal Empathy means I get a temporary meat shield, Tumble is a cross class skill so that soaks up some points.  I guess I just saw two locations for stat increases and it just made sense to spread them out a bit rather than go all out on Wisdom.  I could have tried for dev crit spear, but I already had to burn a lot of feats just to get WM.  I could have boosted CON to get EDR but the Drider already has 5/+20 DR.  Cha would make me look better, but as a Drider I'm rather ugly to begin with.  Mom tells me otherwise tho...  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

I could bump the Int buffs down a notch and move the Wis increase up a few levels, that would give me a few more skill points.

Just wanted to say that this is a very interesting and cool looing build. Big bonus points, in my book, for maxing out Animal Empathy!<br><br>I know you are into Shifter builds Bromium. Could you recommend a "power build" Shifter tank? If that's too vague a request I can try to narrow it, but frankly I know nearly zilch about Shifters.<br><br>I'm kinda looking for a build that focuses on one shape. Something big and menacing preferably <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Power build shifter tank ... my guess would be dr/sh/monk Risen Lord form.  You will only need 10 shifter levels so you can pump up Druid for buffs or Monk for speed/ac.<br><br>Dex does not get overwritten, but as a Monk, you'll get the same ac boost from your monk side, and you'll gain those bonus spells.  you will have less reflex save if you don't have dex.<br><br>Risen Lord is a tank.  slash/pierce 50% immunity, 15/+3 DR, undead bonus immunities (dev crit &amp; sneak immune). but you can be turned.<br><br>so for powergamer shifters... a monk risen lord is what to be.<br><br>Keep in mind that shifters are always going to have low AB compared to real fighter/mellee tanks.
