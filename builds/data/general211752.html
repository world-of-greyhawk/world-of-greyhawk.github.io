Ok, my brain is near meltdown working on these two builds.  They are the product of one build that I just could not fit into 40 levels so I sort of split them apart and these two were born.  <br><br>I'm not very experienced with clerics or archers.

Why so much CHA in the second build? <br><br>I'd suggest looking into an Elf CLC/WIZ/AA build, or possibly a 1/2 Elf CLC/Bard/AA.

charisma is good if making use of divine might.  it will give your arrows some hard to resist damage.<br><br>also, as already mentioned, using bard to get arcane archer might not be a bad idea.  you could still have 20+ cleric levels, which should be enough.  the advantages of higher AB and great damage compensate for the +6 lost from EWS.<br><br>leveling depends on when you wanna get your healing spells.<br><br>just an idea.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

Darn Cin - know I know why you are the master. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    I was toying around with the AA/Clr/Wiz build.  I was thinking:<br>1 - Wiz (With Elf will avoid exp penalty and get free longbow prof)<br>2-13 Clr<br>14-20 AA<br><br>This build is going to be based off the buffing spells of a cleric and I will have, at most times, Divine Favor, Divine Power, Aid, stat buffs, etc. on me.  However, your 15/1/4 idea with Divine Power is most interesting.  I guess it comes down to - do I want a non dispellable 4th attack.  I am planning on having 6 attacks at all times with rapid shot and haste.<br><br>Thank you Cin - you have given me something to think about.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 09/08/05 00:47</span></i></p>

Yeah, the AA enchant arrow bonmus applies to both AB and damage.<br><br>You can't take WIZ as your first class, unless you're willing to invest in INT. The game will force you to take a minimum starting INT of 11. Start with CLC.<br><br>I'd also move Rapid Shot earlier into the build. If you get into point blank range and activate Rapid Shot, you get an extra attack per round and all your attacks are only at a -1 penalty to hit (easily compensated with the high WIS), as PBS gives you +1 to hit and damage at close range.<br><br>With this layout, your saves will be (vs spells):<br><br>Fort: 23 (31)<br>Refl: 20 (28)<br>Will: 33 (41)<br><br>I'd advise taking only 40 points in Spellcraft, as you get +1 bonus to your saves vs spells for every 5 modified ranks (and it's modified by INT), so the 2 extra points won't accomplish much. <br><br>I might also consider starting with 16 WIS and putting 2 points into CON, 2 into INT and one each into STR and DEX, so you'd start thus:<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 14<br>CON 12<br>INT 12<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 8<br><br>This would net you 43 more skill points, which you could use to cross-class Tumble for 20 ranks and +4 to your AC. The extra point in DEX doesn't do much for you, but it evens it out and adds 1 to your Reflex save. CON at 12 means 40 more HPs and an extra +1 to your Fort save. You'd lose 1 on your Will save and 1 on your AB.<br><br>Are you planning on being basically a buffing Cleric with ranged combat capabilities, or did you plan on lobbing spells for offense as well? If the latter, then I'd recommend taking at least 6 more CLC levels, possibly sacrificing 6 AA. Then pick up the Spell Penetration feats. That way you can beat the highest stnadard SR in the game. (You may not be able to beat any custom SR monsters, but you'll beat the default settings). I'd also perhaps keep the 18 WIS at the start. If the former, I'd probably go with the 16 WIS start.<br><br>Your feats look pretty good to me. I'd recommend looking into the Trickery domain, unless you won't have access to Haste items, in which case Travel may be better.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Yes, I am planning more of an Archer with Cleric as support.  Buffs, heals, res, etc.  I wasn't planning on my spells hitting much post 20.  I stayed with 13dex since I'll be wearing heavy armor and that only allows a +1 bonus but your stat allocation makes more sense.  I do need 13 dex for rapid shot.<br><br>The PW I play on is medium magic and has no permanent haste items so I took travel for that reason.  Heal is to give me more healing spells.  I think it turned out quite well.

Another option would be to go with Cleric 20/ Monk 6/ CoT 14.  I did not do a full build, but you can pump your wisdom to about 36 with the CoT feats in epic.  You get more bonus spells, you have a naked AC of 34 which can be increased with empowered owls.  You get some monk speed and are a little better in close combat.  You also have more feats to play with and good saves.  <br><br>However, the AB goes down to 43 unbuffed, which is not bad, but still does not compare to an AA build.  This approach is a little more versatile at the cost of less effectivness with the bow.  Choices...choices...<br><br><br>Drallimer
