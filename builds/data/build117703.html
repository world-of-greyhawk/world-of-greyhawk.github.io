OK someone rightly pointed out my build for Holy Avenger does not work with Weapon Master requirements so here is one that I believe should do...<br><br>This is the first build i have posted so correct it if its wrong pls.

I've been working on a Pal/WM/COT build as well and found this one, but this one has errors.  I just wanted to point them out in case someone else attempts to build this. <br><br>1.  Whirlwind attack is a pre-req for WM and this build has it taken at WM5 or character level 18.  By using the extra feat for a human you can overcome this by shifting your feats up some.<br><br>2.  Biggest error is that epic COT gets bonus feats every 3 levels past 10 and not 2!  That severly changes the build.  You can't get all the feats stated that way!

Gray,<br><br>Rather than ask people to point out errors, why don't you go build this character yourself, post the correct leveling guide, and then ask for feedback on a buildable character?<br><br>Kaliban

Would this build benefit at all from going into CoT first for feat boosting. You could end up getting more CoT levels and less paly. Paly really doesn't add much after level 3 where CoT does add a lot. Pehaps something like paly 8/CoT 25/WM 7 would yeild a lot more feats and higher saves withough sacrificing anything but a few paly spells.<br><br>Also why not use that last ability (or one of the earlier ones to bring one of your other stats to an even number. Leaving STR at 17 doesn't do anythign for you, but raising INT to 14 early means a lot mroe skill points.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 12/06/04 18:35</span></i></p>

I think this leveling guide should do the trick. I removed epic prowess to get access to great smite 10. I would also suggest go all Cha instead of taking 2 Str, but that choice is entirely up to you. I also sacced 2 pala levels because I didn't feel they added up much to the build. 22 CoT instead of 20 CoT +2 pala gives you better saves, 1 extra feat, better divine wrath. <br><br>1 P1 Dodge, Feat of your choice if human (aka KD)<br>2 P2<br>3 P3 Weapon Focus (Longsword)<br>4 P4 (Cha 16)<br>5 P5<br>6 P6 Expertise<br>7 P7<br>8 P8 (Cha 17)<br>9 P9 Mobility<br>10 P10<br>11 P11<br>12 CoT1 Spring Attack (Cha 18)<br>13 CoT2 Whirlwind attack<br>14 WM1 <br>15 WM2 Improved Crit (Longsword)<br>16 WM3 (Cha 19)<br>17 WM4<br>18 WM5 Knockdown (or impr KD if human)<br>19 WM6<br>20 WM7 (Cha 20)<br>21 COT3 Great Cha I (21)<br>22 COT4 Extra Smiting<br>23 COT5<br>24 COT6 Epic Weapon Focus, Great Cha 2 (22), (Cha 23)<br>25 COT7<br>26 COT8 Great Cha 3 (24)<br>27 COT9 Great Smite 1<br>28 COT10 Great Smite 2 (Cha 25)<br>29 COT11<br>30 COT12 Great Smite 3<br>31 COT13 Great Smite 4<br>32 COT14 (Str 15)<br>33 COT15 Great Smite 5<br>34 COT16 Great Smite 6<br>35 COT17<br>36 COT18 Great Smite 7, (Str 16)<br>37 COT19 Great Smite 8<br>38 COT20 <br>39 COT21 Great Smite 9<br>40 COT22 Great Smite 10, (Str 16, Cha 26)

Nice idea.<br><br>Though i have to point out a thing i noticed (it got me with my druid/shifter/cot build..  COT post epic has bonus feat on every 4 lvls not 3  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   <br><br>And if i built my dude right (i tried a cha pally/cot) great smite requires charisma of 25??<br><br>Peace

Actually some problems with this one too.<br><br>Previous poster was correct in that you need CHA=25 to take Great Smiting feasts.  Also, COT epic bonus feats are 1 every 4 levels past 10.  Basically with this latest build you have to take Great Cha 4 at lv27 and push off Great Smiting until level 28 (COT10).  You end up with Great Smiting 8 on lv40 (COT22).  I didn't build it to verify, but I'm fairly sure that's how it would work out.
