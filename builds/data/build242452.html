Yet another Halfling Kukri wielder, but a concealed one.<br><br>the goal was to get a Dex Base rogue, with Epic Dodge, Maxed self-concealment, but also Epic weapon specialization, to counterbalance a little the lake of strength a deal some more damages, and also to have improved knockdown, wich seems to me a necessity for a soloing rogue, in order to deal some sneak attacks.<br><br><br>Race: Halfling<br>Alignment: Any<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 20<br>Con 12<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Dodge<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse<br>03: Fighter(2): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Weapon Focus: Kukri<br>04: Rogue(2): DEX+1, {Evasion}, (DEX=21)<br>05: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>06: Fighter(3): expertise<br>07: Fighter(4): mobility<br>08: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>09: Rogue(5): spring attack<br>10: Fighter(5)<br>11: Fighter(6): Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br>12: Rogue(6): DEX+1, Whirlwind Attack, (DEX=23)<br>13: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Kukri<br>14: Weapon Master(2)<br>15: Weapon Master(3): Improved Critical: Kukri<br>16: Weapon Master(4): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>17: Weapon Master(5)<br>18: Weapon Master(6): knockdown<br>19: Weapon Master(7)<br>20: Rogue(7): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>21: Rogue(8): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=26)<br>22: Rogue(9)<br>23: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br>24: Fighter(7): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri, (DEX=27)<br>25: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br>26: Fighter(9)<br>27: Fighter(10): Great Dexterity II, Improved Knockdown, (DEX=28)<br>28: Rogue(11): DEX+1, (DEX=29)<br>29: Rogue(12)<br>30: Rogue(13): epic dodge, Defensive Roll<br>31: Rogue(14)<br>32: Rogue(15): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br>33: Rogue(16): Self Concealment I, Self Concealment II<br>34: Rogue(17)<br>35: Rogue(18)<br>36: Rogue(19): DEX+1, Self Concealment III, Self Concealment IV, (DEX=31)<br>37: Rogue(20)<br>38: Fighter(11)<br>39: Fighter(12): Self Concealment V, Epic prowess<br>40: Rogue(21): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 32<br>Con 12<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Skills<br><br>Hitpoints: 356<br><br>Skillpoints: 316<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/16/34<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +5, Fear: +2<br><br>BAB: 28<br>AB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 42 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/30<br><br>Discipline 42(42)<br>Hide 43(54)<br>Intimidate 4(3)<br>Move Silently 43(56)<br>Open Lock 43(54)<br>Spellcraft 20(22)<br>Tumble 43(54)<br>UMD 43(42)<br><br><br>Feel free to comment , I'm playing this character for some time now, and having great fun with him.<br><br><br><br>Renegade.

WM 7 is a waste of time. You get +1 AB, and the basic critical bonuses for ... what? 5 feats? Drop rogue to 19, and fighter to 8. It'll make up more for your expenditure without taxing you overmuch.<br><br>Besides that - this is a happy fun-time cause mass carnage with your toes build.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

WM 7 gives an extented 2 critical range, wich I think is greatly valuable, having crits on 10-20 with a keen weapon means hitting 55% of the time against non crit-immune foes....<br><br>regarding your other comments, i dont figure how having ED ans SC5 by dropping either Fighter or Rogue levels<br><br>Renegade.

The point is that with your base damage, the increased crit range and multiplier will hardly make a difference. Even with magical weapons. I would even consider going dagger to save a feat. You would increase you amount of feats by going Rogue 28, Fighter12. Having Rogue12 pre-epic and taking ED at lvl 21. When you feel the need to start with 20 DEX, then use it to max efficiency. you should still have room for SCV.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Criticals don't multiply sneak attacks, and if you're fighting something you can crit on, you can sneak attack it to death in short order with 21 rogue levels.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
