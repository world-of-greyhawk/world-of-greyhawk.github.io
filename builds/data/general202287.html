I need to know, doesn't WF and EWF:unarmed or possibly epic prowess help you in shifted forms, like bear, dragon? And does ability stats stack, f.ex 2 str from armor, and two strength from shield?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 07/02/05 06:41</span></i></p>

IIRC statistic bonuses from different sources all carry over into a shifted form, I think that epic prowess also carries over as well, but Im fairly sure that epic weapon focus unarmed strike dosen't carry over, since when shifted into a creature you are actually using a "creature weapon" like a claw or bite attack.

M1ke is correct.  For some strange reason though, improved critical: unarmed carries over to your unarmed shapes.  Never quite figured out why, but I know it does.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Thats what I saw, thats why I asked. And all other abilities, like monk attack schedule. Well, that compromises my build somewhat, but it being in a world where most people have only +5 weps, the DR in dragonform gets good. Wish they had fixed this.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
