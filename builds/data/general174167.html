The synergy between these classes seems painfully obvious but, try as I might, I cannot find a build like this listed even though I am sure that I have seen reference to it in the fora. <br>Any basic outline for this class would be appreiciated.<br>Thanks.<br>M_Prometheus

I was looking for a Construct form, unarmed melee type. Yes, there are many out there and I did find several that I like. I still am not really too sure about how the skills of the character transfer into the shifted shapes but there is plenty of info around here and I'm studying it thouroghly.<br>I also wouldnt mind looking at a Risenlord shape but I'm sure I will come across one of those too.<br>Thanks<br>M_Prometheus
