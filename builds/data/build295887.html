This is a bit of a one trick pony, but it’s a good trick.  Having become addicted to divine damage, I wanted to create a character who could deliver the most amount of divine damage not only consistently, but to be able to do so better than anyone else.  I also wanted to avoid icky xp penalties and  alignment switches.  As a result, I’ve cooked up this combo which hasn’t been done in the guild except once, and that was a few weeks ago by Cinnabar Din, the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "294723", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Eldritch Archer</a>.  That was a more balanced archer that minored in magocracy.  This cannon, however, just does one thing, and that’s blowing things up with a divine bow.   With a capped charisma score, one can get up to 20 Divine uses per rest cycle that will land 17 points of Divine damage bolstered by +15 Enchant Arrow.  Toss some Mighty properties and elemental arrows and some party buffs, and the howitzer will be landing crits in the neighborhood of  100-150.  <br><br><br><br><b>The Divine Howitzer</b><br><br>Paladin 10/ Wizard 1/ Arcane Archer 29<br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Lawful/Good<br>Playable: 1-40, PvM, mid-magic<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str13<br>Int11<br>Wis8<br>Dex18 (20)<br>Con10<br>Chr15(32)<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Wizard1, Point Blank Shot<br>2 Paladin1<br>3 Paladin2, Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>4 Paladin3, Chr16<br>5 Paladin4<br>6 Paladin5, Power Attack<br>7 Paladin6<br>8 AA1, Chr17<br>9 Paladin7, Divine Might<br>10 AA2<br>11 AA3<br>12 Paladin8, Divine Shield, Chr18<br>13 AA4<br>14 AA5<br>15 AA6, Improved Crit: Longbow<br>16 AA7, Chr19<br>17 AA8<br>18 AA9, Rapid Shot<br>19 AA10<br>20 Paladin9, Chr20<br>21 AA11, Great Charisma I<br>22 AA12<br>23 AA13<br>24 AA14, EWF: Longbow, Great Chr II, Chr23<br>25 AA15<br>26 AA16<br>27 AA17, Great Chr III<br>28 AA18, Epic Prowess, Chr25<br>29 AA19<br>30 AA20, Great Chr IV<br>31 AA21<br>32 AA22, Great Dex I, Chr27<br>33 AA23, Great Chr V<br>34 AA24<br>35 AA25<br>36 AA26, Great Chr VI, Great Dex II, Chr30<br>37 AA27<br>38 AA28<br>39 AA29, Great Chr VII<br>40 Paladin10, Chr32<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 53/48/43/38<br>Rapid Shot AB: 51/46/41/36/51<br>HP: 330<br>AC: 23 (mundane plate)<br>Damage: 1-8/(19-20/x3)+15Enchant Arrow+11Divine<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 33<br>Will:  28<br>Reflex: 35<br><br><b>Skills</b>: 144<br>Taunt: 43 (54)<br>Tumble: 20<br>Listen: 43<br>Search: 6<br>Persuade: 1<br>Open Lock: 2<br>Lore: 1<br><br><b>Advantages:</b><br>Massive Firepower<br>Strong Saves<br>Imbue Arrow: 19d6<br><br><b>Disadvanatges</b><br>Low Hit Points<br>One-trick Pony<br>No Blindfighting (but even if 50% of his shots miss, the bad guy is still in trouble)<br>Low AC (but can be remedied by turning on Divine Shield)<br><br><br>_________<br><br><br><i>Fixed level up guide - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/01/09 16:41</span></i></p>

I can't free myself from the feeling that this should be yet another needleslinger that would benefit from being HalfBreed. You'd lose the Elfs keen senses and a whole point of AB and AC. You'd gain 40 hitpoints and the possibility to use Bard for 3 more AC and the possibility for UMD, or sorcerer for a not insignificant number of true strikes when the baddy-two-shoes feels he is well protected with shiny new armour of High-AC-anti-Elf plate. Then you scream True Strike, Divine Might, Rapid shot and quickly turns baddy-two-shoes into a Divinely Burning Porcupine. That would be lovely, juuuuuust lovely.<br><br>Actually changing race might also let you lower INT to 10 to get STR to 14. Or even leave CON at 10 and take 12 INT and 14STR to get the extra skillpoints needed for UMD.<br><br>Cool build. Think I'll have to try using this, or a variant.

Oh, you're right, of course that a half-elf would provide for a more balanced character, but I wasn't going for balance.  I knew that I could squeeze one more AB out of an elf than I could the half-elf (but I did try that way first, as it made the most sense).  Additionally, a couple of Paladin/Bard combos have already been done, and I just don't care for the alignment switching.  Seems tacky.  This seemed to be the most elegant solution in which one can get the highest AB with a bow to insure that every hit was a divine hit.  Admittedly I was a bit narrow-minded, for I usually opt for the balanced solo-artist characters, but I was going for shock value.  I think a character like this would excel in a team, but because he can lay the holy smackdown with his yew, there's a soloability about him.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Yeah, forgot about the alignment for a weak second there, sorry. But I still feel the loss of one AB by going Sorcerer and Half-Elf might be worth it. Also, this is a guy that is easily soloable, although Called Shot: leg would make it more so.<br><br>You can also take the 20% xp-penalty and go Elf sorcerer.

I would drop 2 Great Charisma feats for for Called Shot and Extra Turning.  Slightly lower Charisma, loss of about 3AB, but I'd get net gain of two DM uses, and would also have a nice little pack of maxed Divine Favors that we could slap on the bow attack.  I believe the Divine Favor does Magical Damage, which would make for a nice feathered cocktail of damage intoxication.  Hmmm.... that's nearly a completely different build.  I should have a look at that.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I hate to break it to you, Mr.Grizzled, but this might just be a decent PvP build too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->While he's got a big gun, he's soft and squishy in the middle.

There's no incentive to take further Paladin levels.  One can take one more, but it really doesn't amount to much.  There's no smiting involved, no Paladin spells, he's just a big ole divine blunderbuss.  The only reason 8 are taken in pre-epic is that one can't take moer than 10 AA.  So, no AB is lost with the 2nd Wizard level, and it gives a Will Save bump while the 9th Pally level didn't really give much other then 1-6 more hitpoints.

Doh!  So much for a longer spell duration...<br><br>Edit: Oh, and, psst... in the variant, there's no Grt Cha I.  Not that it matters, and it's definitely not worth resurectin' the poor thing, but methinks it only takes three Grt Cha, that is, until it becomes an elven wizard, and looses Craft Wand, but, just sayin', there seems a wee typo in there.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By onion eater on 08/28/08 09:52</span></i></p>

If interested in spellcraft, that second wizard level could be a skill dump.<br><br>On the subject of skills, do you use taunt a lot with archers?  The bard archers can take taunt too, but do you get to taunting range much?
