Over all it performed as well as could be expected. I enjoyed having the Assassin's guaranteed once-a-day abilities at my disposal. Even with UMD, it was always nice to know I had something to fall back on when my scrollcase was empty.  Which is probably why I enjoyed it more than a typical "Rogue" build.

Why bother with Rogue levels 4 and 5? Take 2 more fighter levels pre-epic instead, and end up Rogue 3/Fighter 8/Assassin 29. Gains you 1 BAB, 1 attack per round, and 1 pre-epic feat of your choice (I recommend Toughness for 40 more HP). The only cost is 12 skill points.<br><br>Also, on skills, check the Grimoire for the max required to disarm traps. You can save quite a few by re-arranging those, without losing the ability to disarm all but Epic traps. To disarm all Deadly traps, you only need 36, and with 14 Int and synergy with Set traps that means only 32 ranks (saves 11). You need 22 in Search to detect all but Epic traps, so pump Search by 12 (no point in being able to disarm what you can't detect). For Set Traps, I would aim for 45 (to set Deadly traps), which means you need 30 ranks with no Dex buffs. I would probably drop Open Locks to pump Set Traps some more. Traps can be real life-savers for Assassins/Rogues when facing sneak-immune enemies (Holy Traps are especially nice against Undead).<br><br>TM

Thanks Dmuzzy another question about this build is say you wanted to use Rapiers as a Main Hand weapon and a short short sword or a dagger as an offhand weapon what would be some pointers to that?
