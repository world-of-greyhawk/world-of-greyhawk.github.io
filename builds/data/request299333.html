Okay.. contrary to the title, I actually only need one build.<br><br>I'm looking for a build with good spellcasting power, very high saves, and good AC.<br><br>I've heard few utter the name of, Sorcerer/Paladin/Blackguard, and that has interested me.<br><br>But I'm very in-experienced with the finger-twiddling group, and don't know how to put one together.<br><br>Can anyone help?

I already made one: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "262838", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Graced Sorcerer (Sorcerer 37 / Paladin 1 / Blackguard 2)</a>. It's designed for level 40 PvP, so you should take the second Blackguard level earlier if you're going to play it straight.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

the pal/bk is a bit of an exploit and requires that your server allow alignment changes.  <br><br>The other option would be a sorc/pal/rdd.  You could do that build and get lv 9 sorc spells, charisma based (so you get nice saves and DC) and you could squeak in Dev crit!  Thats My idea of a good caster!  One that hits hard and casts hard!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
