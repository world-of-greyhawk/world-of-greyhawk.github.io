At Shifter level 7, you gain access to the Kobold Commando, and most of your problems are solved, but once you start taking Assassin levels you can go ahead and kick the party rogue to the side of the road (just pray you don't run across any epic traps <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">       ).<br><br>Rogue actually would have been a much preferable build design choice for the additional skill points, evasion, and the rogue only bonus feats. . .just be a human or halfling to avoid the XP penalty.  However, as I understand it, Kobold Commando SA overrides Rogue SA, which is a big problem.  Fortunately for the concept, Assassin DA or Blackguard SA stacks with Kobold Commando SA.<br><br>It's possible to switch the level split up to Druid 7/ Shifter 17/ Assassin 16, which would gain you a +6 shortsword w/ 2d4 acid damage and 2d6 massive criticals, Improved Evasion, +3 AC, 3d6 additional Kobold SA damage, and 2 (epic shifter) bonus feats (Great Wis I &amp; II and you have access to 3rd and 4th level druid spells).  However, you would lose 10 to the death attack DC, 5d6 DA damage, and 3 epic assassin bonus feats (which are slightly better than the epic shifter bonus feat choices, imho).  I prefer the version posted mostly because a 50% increased chance of success to the Death Attack is nothing to sneeze at, especially when you only get one shot, even though the Epic Kobold Commando does have some clear advantages (higher average damage, for one, whether or not sneak attacks are being landed).<br><br>If so inclined, shifting ability scores around will grant access to level 3 and 4 druid spells, and is mostly a playstyle decision.  If the decision were mine, I'd drop Strength by 1 point, bump Wisdom up to 14, and exchange armor skin for another Great Str feat, but there are a couple of other equally viable options.<br><br>Under normal circumstances, the Improved Sneak Attack feat will not stack with Assassin DA unless you have SA from either Rogue or Blackguard.  I haven't tested this, but I imagine gaining SA from Kobold may allow proper stacking of the feat.  If so, then it is possible to replace any of the final 3 epic assassin bonus feats with Improved Sneak Attack.<br><br>Comments/ Criticisms/ Suggestions welcome <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br><i>Corrected title.

<b>Dusk</b><br>Revli carefully surveyed his surroundings, looking for any potential spies.  Getting caught doing what he was about to would mean the end of his cover in this little town, and he wasn't about to let that happen.  Hearing nothing, he closed his eyes and began focusing his mind inwards, towards the very center of his being.  Slowly, the pulsing, blackened remnants of a dwarven heart came into focus.  With all his energy, Revli began shaping what he saw in his mind's eye into the pulsing, blackened heart of a sickening, leather faced kobold.  As he pulled his focus external to himself once again, Revli had lost all traces of his dwarven heritage; Revli had become the kobold he imagined.<br><br>* * *<br><br><b>Dawn</b><br>As Revli went on his morning walk, he took special care to route past the town crier.  He derived a special pleasure from hearing his last job announced to the public, like he was the star in a play no one knew they had tickets for.  For the last 6 months, the news was always the same.  There was always one dead body, one witness, and one report of a rotten toothed kobold sitting atop the corpse, wiping the blood from his shortsword, then disappearing into the shadows as quickly as he was spotted.  To an outside observer, Revli might seem apathetic, but on the inside, there was something different.  Yes, on the inside, the heart of a grinning kobold could still be heard beating.

Hm, I think this is a really interesting build. Seems to need a lot of thorough testing before we can utilize it's full potential, but I assume that you have tested that at least the Kobold sneak attack stacks with your regular, and thus improved sneak attack would indeed stack when in kobold form. Nice catch. <br><br>Cool build there. Not sure how useful it is in other shapes though, but going high strebgth in a form that doesn't override STr is smart.<br><br>Again, really interesting.

Her's used a high Int to maintain a functional DA DC, while having kobold form override her otherwise crummy Dexterity.  On paper they may look similar, but the difference in the primary stat will change significantly how the two versions are actually played.<br><br>And, as others have mentioned, HiPS only functions when in kobold form.  All of the other posted advantages are in kobold form (15d6 sneak attack drops to 13d6 when in dwarf form, for example).  I listed the advantages that way because, well, that's how the character is meant to be played.  Natural form stats aren't exactly crummy, though.  You still have good stealth even in medium armor, and with Strength as a primary stat and a decent Constitution, you can function in combat.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By koolthursday on 08/20/06 19:16</span></i></p>

Ullo *pokes head into thread* <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>I haven't been around much lately, but I do love shifters and couldn't help myself now. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Anyways, I figured I'd clear up the issue of sneak attacks and stacking for the kobold. The kobold shape gets rogue sneak attack as a bonus feat from an item, so it stacks with assassin and BG sneak attack but not with rogue sneak attack. For a build like this, 8d6 death attack would allow you to get improved sneak attack feats, but as far as I know that still doesn't work with death attack so it would normally be useless. <b>However</b>, it does work with the rogue sneak attack that kobolds get, so it might be worth taking a few.<br><br>And nice build of course <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I realize this is oooooooooold.

But with 5 druid you get +3 BAB and with 3 shifter you get +2 BAB, which makes +5 BAB... Improved knockdown requires +7 BAB.<br><br>Am I stupid or something?

I had a nice answer all done up about 4 years ago, alas, i have forgotten t <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   Alas, the answer is probably as simple as a mistake from translating the build to this format.  It happens quite alot, and in this build it isnt a big deal.  Simply take blind fight at 9 and move ikd to 12 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   You have to remember that while a build appears to be a permanant thing, they are really just suggestions.  Personally, i wouldnt have taken ikd cuz i never used kd, so i would have had 2 open feats in this guy, had i played him.  <br><br>The whole thing with ECB guild ISNT to creat zombies.  I believe Anuis wanted to have a place for creative interaction, and you should really look at the builds as suggestions, using the suggestion to make a build that is uniquely yours.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 06/02/10 00:27</span></i></p>

Thanks, that helped.<br><br>BTW, I wasn't going to use this exact build. I was just wondering, because I wasn't sure if this was a good build if they didn't pay attention to that... Anyways, thanks.

I found this build to be very interesting. You have come up with a unique concept, congrats!<br><br>However, I have somethings to ask and add if I may.<br><br>1- Why Druid 7? 5 is enough to get Shifter and your wisdom is not high enough to cast lvl 4 spells. So why?? If it is for Spellcraft Skill dumps, then why not take Druid (6) at lvl 22 and Druid (7) at lvl 37 to get the most out of your saves? You must have 40 RANKS in Spellcraft to get the +8 save bonus. The way you listed this, you only get +7.<br><br>2- You mentioned an alternate way to do this (Druid 7 / Assassin 16 / Shifter 17). Why not Druid 5 / Shifter 17, Assassin 18? That way you'll get an extra Assassin Bonus Feat and 1d6 extra Death Attack at virtually no cost! BTW, the Epic Kobold Commando gets Invisibility, in case you have used HiPS in the last 5 seconds. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>3- Doesn't Improved Critical work while shifted? If it does, then you gotta find a way to squeeze it in there. You could drop Toughness or choose Human instead of Dwarf to get it in. Either way you lose 40 HP. Human would also mean more Skill Points. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>That is all I have to add. Very interesting build. I might try it after I finish my current campaign.<br><br>Take it EZ!<br><br>P.S.: It's a SHAME that none of the 3 classes have martial weapon proficiency and you gotta waste a feat on it. Oh well, I guess it's the cost of being original ^^

Yeah, but from that I didn't get that ABILITY MODIFIERS influence the saves. To me, that still means ranks. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is how I see it:<br><br>- BASE RANKS = Number of points spent on the skill<br><br>- MODIFIED RANKS = Number of points spent on the skill + feats that also enhance those skills.<br><br>- SKILL MODIFIER = MODIFIED RANKS + the ability modifier.<br><br>I might be getting it wrong, but that's how I always thought it worked.<br><br>Take it EZ!
