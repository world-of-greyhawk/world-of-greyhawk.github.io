Hey all,<br>I am building an almost pure sorceror and have a multiclassing dilemma: I have to choose between 1 level of monk or 1 level of sd to add to my build. What do you recommend? Hipsing when in trouble sounds nice, or does casting invis on yourself work as well when in a tight spot? Curious about your thoughts, help is appreciated.<br><br>BTW: playing a PW with limited use of Greater Sanctuary.<br>BTW2: What is in your humble but honest opinion the most useful familiar for a pure sorc?<br><br>Thanks!<br>B.<br>_________________<br>Everything`s been done, everything`s been said so why bother

IMHO SD is better for a multiclass Wizard who has more skill points to actually make Hide/Move Silently useful. Monk will give you a bit more AC and discipline, always useful.<br><br>On familiars: Eyeball can have its uses even in very high levels, Pseudodragon gives you True Seeing when you posses them, Pixie helps with locks, Ice Mephit is a beast to help low level casters hunt for XP.<br>_________________<br>It's fear of god that brought us to that state.<br>How fortunate the man with none.<br><br>Bertold Brecht

When I play a caster, my summons are only as good as how much tanking they can do (that's why Animal Companion with Feeding beats every other summon tenfold). Not sure if that works with Familiars as I think you get some penalty if he gets killed, don't remember exactly.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/28/10 07:42</span></i></p>

Yes, you can Feed familiars to full HPs just like Animal Companions, and the damage you take when they die is 1d6 magical. I really like using a summon and the familiar when playing with a low level caster, but they really lose their "tanking" usefulness quite early. The familiars I was suggesting can be of some (limited) use after their HP is too low or their attacks innefective. The Eyeball has A LOT of nasty castings of varied rays, for example. Still, apart from the fun factor and some very peculiar circunstances, familiars are not something that make it or break it for casters after a certain level.<br>_________________<br>Like Prometheus we are bound,<br>Chained to this rock of a brave new world,<br>Our godforsaken lot.
