I was wondering what is the best possible AC and AB in a build. I have a build that has a AC of 85 and AB of 59 and it seems high but when i play on a server vault mod i get my *** kicked by most people. How do i get a higher AB, AC. Does anyone here have a really strong build suggestion? I would really appreciate help. Ive been looking for a UBER build for over a year and cant seem to get it anywhere so if someone would be able to help me id be horribly glad. I figured where better to ask for such a thing then in the epic char. builders guild forum.

Why don't you post your current build? Perhaps a tweak or two may make the difference. Besides, most people would love to have an AC of 85 AND an AB of 59+.

It depends on what items are available. When most people post on the epic build page they post the naked (ie basic non magical items) stats, for comparison reasons.<br><br>If thats the AB and AC for basic items then you have hit the jackpot ).<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Using the search function could also be helpful.
