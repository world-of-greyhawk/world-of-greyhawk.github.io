This dragon will resist dev crit and almost anything that requires a fort save, and its buffs are immune from Greater Dispel, which helps a great deal when you consider how much dragons rely on their buffs.  <br><br>Oh, and it gets 8 APR when hasted and using stunning claw.  Which is nice when you are up against high AC builds.<br><br>This is similar but different to the variation I suggested in connection with Thrax's Stunning Claw <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238749", "0", ",", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> which is also fun.<br><br>Good hunting.<br><br><b>The Avenging Dragon</b><br><br>Druid 26/Monk 6/CoT 8 - Human <br>PvM 1-40, PvP 39-40 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     <br><br>Lawful, Non-Evil<br><br>Str 8 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 8<br>Wis 18 to 30<br>Int 14<br>Cha 15 to 16<br><br>1 Druid 1 LoH, Extend Spell<br>2 Monk 1 [Cleave, Evasion]<br>3 Druid 2 WF Kama <br>4 Druid 3 +wis 19<br>5 Druid 4 : <br>6 Druid 5: Empower Spell<br>7 Monk 2: <br>8 Druid 6: +wis 20<br>9 Druid 7 : GFort<br>10 Druid 8<br>11 CoT 1<br>12 Monk 3 +wis 21, Disarm<br>13 CoT 2 Resist Energy: Cold<br>14 CoT 3<br>15 CoT 4 Toughness, Imp.

Noticed a carry over on the AB: Divine Wrath for this one is only +3 (level 5 CoT), not +9 (as it would be for a level 20 CoT).  Can I get that edited in the original post?<br><br>Many thanks, Grip/Cinn/Grim/Finneous et al lol, and cheers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 02/03/07 23:33</span></i></p>

You mispelled my name! I'll have to teach you a lesson <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  oh well, typos happen.<br><br>Why do you take so much Druid? more CoT would render higher saves, more feats and higher Divine Wrath (you were taking 20 CoT when you showed your variant on my build btw), it's not casting oriented either...

If I ever stumble into spelling your name right <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Sorry 'bout that Thax.<br><br>Oh, the 26 caster levels are for one thing only, although they do open up a few options casting wise: non-dispellable buffs.  You lose saves BUT your fort save still puts Dev Crit out of reach unless you roll a one.  You lose no AB.  You lose +6 on Divine Wrath BUT divine wrath lasts such a short time I felt it was a fair trade off.  <br><br>So it's different.  <br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Ithacan

EWF does not carry over into dragon shape, only IC and EP work. Good build though.

Ithacan, you forgot to do your homeworks about DS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I fixed the dragon shape stats (you didn't take into consideration huge size, +6 dragon claws and the fact that WF/EWF: unarmed do not work for unarmed shapes).
