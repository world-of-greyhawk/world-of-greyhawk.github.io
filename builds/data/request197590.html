This is another build that also fits, which I posted a few days ago.  I gets 5d6 more sneak attacks, as well as epic prowess and toughness (although Syrath's build has a free feat at level 18 that you could use for toughness if you wanted).  The leveling was designed to have no XP penalty with an elf, but of course with a halfling you wouldn't have to worry about that, so you could squeeze an extra +1 AB out of it if you go monk 12/rogue 8 or monk 8/rogue 12 pre-epic.  You wouldn't have to change the stats at all though, as I believe it would take a halfling the same number of points to reach those initial stats as it would an elf.  It does give up a few of the low level SD bonuses, like Shadow Evade/Daze and the low level summoned shadow.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198041", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Acolyte of Shadows (Monk 20/Rogue 19/SD 1)</a><br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/09/05 23:48</span></i></p>

Wow, that one's nice too!<br><br>As an afterthought, how would you guys do this build (or similar) with the max number of monk levels possible while keeping the epic dodge/scV foundation in tact?  Is there any way to squeeze more monk levels out of Syrath's posted build?

The fact is, for most Epic Dodge/Self Concealment builds, your epic progression is so rigid (you must have Great Dex I and II, Epic Dodge, and Self Concealment I-V), that as long as you have your prereqs together, it writes itself because there's virtually no flexibility.  What I generally do is work backwards, fitting in all the Self Concealment feats after level 32 (generally the first level you can take SC I unless you manage to squeeze in another Great Dex), and then filling in the rest.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/10/05 07:23</span></i></p>
