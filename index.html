			<h2>Server Rules</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Do not kill ANYTHING that isn't hostile to you. Do not cast harmful area effect spells near NPCs. Leave the merchants alone. This includes animals, clergy, cobblers, fishmongers, makers of fine meats, blacksmiths, jewelers, and Panthers named Tiny.
				<li>Pickpocketing of NPCs is not allowed. Pickpocketing of PCs is allowed, but only in PvP areas.
				<li>Food is required for rest. Food will automatically be deducted upon rest.
				<li>Hardcore rules as to bleeding are in effect. A player does not die at 0 hit points, but is unconscious. That player will bleed 1 hp each round unless treated by someone with a healing kit, using the heal skill, or casting a healing spell. There is also a 10% chance per round of bleeding stopping on its own. The new healing kits do not restore hit points, but the OC healing kits, when found, will do so.
				<li>Spell and feat changes are noted in other threads.
				<li>No player grieving.
				<li>No use of obscene language on the forum or the server.
				<li>Oil can be used to create campfires or tossed onto enemies.
				<li>Abuse of PvP (picking on lower level characters) or pickpocketing will be dealt with harshly.
				<li>No powerleveling. Parties are expected to contain players within 3 levels of each other until level 20, within 4 levels if in the 20-30th level range, and within 5 levels if 30+. Higher level characters should not reduce monsters to within a few hit points to allow a lower level character to kill it.
				<li>Penalty for death is, for now, 50 xp per level and 10% gold.
				<li>Do not expect the usual magical loot. The magic items on this server are plentiful, but less powerful than most servers.
				<li>Healing potions, though labeled similarly, may have different levels associated with them. Healing potions do not automatically restore the maximum hit points per level imbued. Please check healing potions before buying them. Some healing potions are found under the merchant's miscellaneous tab. Those healing potions can be used on others who are bleeding.
				<li>Let each player play as they wish when it comes to RP. RP is not mandatory, but ridiculing/harassing/annoying RP is forbidden.
				<li>Guilds may be made in the future.
				<li>Overall plot may be discovered once the players have earned the trust of the higher ups through level advancement.
				<li>Bluff is not used on this server. Persuade is used on rare occasion. Appraise is being added to new merchants and will slowly be added to old merchants (which are the majority).
				<li>Party play is recommended as the server is difficult.
				<li>The forest around Borderkeep are recommended for beginning players. However, in most areas, particularly outdoors, spawns will adjust to your level.  The Village of Hommlet has also been added as a starting option for new characters.
				<li>A newer version of lockpicks are being used. Rogues will have them switched out by the DM upon discovery.  Edit:  This seems to have changed.
				<li>Do NOT go AFK during a conversation with an NPC, especially a merchant. You prevent other players from talking to that NPC.
				<li>Do not steal the loot from another player's kills.
				<li>Have fun! If you have a group that wishes to play, you can contact me and I will try to DM any events you wish to schedule.
				<li>These rules may be changed at any time.
				<li>A technical rule - if you have two computers playing from one IP via router, make sure that you have different ports set for the computers.
				<li>Also, quests are not to be repeated by an individual/group.
				<li>Players should not avoid easy spawns. That is, if you spawn it and know you can kill it, you should do so. The server has sometimes been cluttered with monsters that were avoided by players who could easily defeat them because they are in a hurry to get somewhere. Such spawning can slow down the server. This problem has been partly remedied by a clean up script, but even so, with the large areas a lot of creatures could be spawned before you leave the area. There will not be any monster defeats by attrition for most areas. Monsters either rest or despawn after players leave in most areas.
				<li>The appraise skill is never used. Bluff or intimidate may be used once or twice, but persuade is used more often and is a better choice. If bluff or intimidate are used, a persuade choice is also available. Vice versa is not necessarily true.
					<br/>EDIT: The appraise skill is being used in newly created areas. It may retroactively be added to merchants.
					<br/>EDIT 2: It has been added to merchants now.
				<li>Light gems are in the shops for the benefit of players. Players are not to buy the gems simply to add to an item and then sell the item for quick cash. If I catch this, the player will be punished. If I catch this repeatedly, gems will be removed.
				<li>Selling items with continual flame for the sake of quick coin is also banned.
				<li>Finally, turning invisible and looting lairs without fighting is not permitted. This can lag the server. It's cheesy, and I for one don't want to be the next player to run the gauntlet of clearing an area only to find the treasure already robbed. If it continues, you can expect for bosses to automatically have true seeing and/or impossible traps that cast invisibility purge, etc.

			<h2>Files to Download</h2>

			<h3>Required</h3>
			<p>The World of Greyhawk Server requires Neverwinter Nights 1.69 including both the Shadows of the Undrentide and the Hordes of the Underdark expansions as well as the Community Expansion Project version 2.65.  This allows for a wide variety of content and helps provide players with the best possible experience.
			<p>To download the CEP, visit <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=96573&amp;id=7849" target=" _blank">the Vault</a>.

			<h3>Optional</h3>
			<h4>Portraits</h4>
			<p>DM Raine:  I've collected a lot over time and I've posted the ones that I thought were good. Just download this collection into your portraits folder under the NWN folder on your hard drive.  If you don't have a portraits folder, create one.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Portraits.Detail&amp;id=5759" target="_blank">Portraits Compilation</a>

			<h4>Goblin Override</h4>
			<p>DM Raine:  I like this goblin override. It just changes the appearance of goblins you run across. Just download into your override folder: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Creatures.Detail&amp;id=601" target="_blank">Goblin Enhancement Override</a>

			<h4>Undead Override</h4>
			<p>DM Raine:  I'm also enjoying an undead override, especially good for those who've played a lot and are tired of seeing the same undead. Again, just download into your override folder:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Creatures.Detail&amp;id=108290&amp;id=598">Undead Override</a>

			<h4>Amethyst Dragon's Transparent GUI Override</h4>
			<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=46783&amp;id=1433">The Amethyst Dragon's Transparent GUI Override</a>

			<h4>Others</h4>
			<p>It is highly recommended that players not use other overrides (other than GUI/Interface ones) as this can affect the overall performance of the server.

			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>For old school players, the World of Greyhawk hardly needs description. This was the birthplace an origin of many monsters, heroes and places that are now as common as household words-- Mordenkainen, Bigby, Tenser, Rary, Iuz the Old, Vecna, Tharizdun, and more. Players will find themselves in the hotbed of the central Flanaess, and will find such places as The Free City of Greyhawk, The Wild Coast, The Abbor Alz and Bright Desert, The Shield Lands, The Gnarley Forest, Village of Hommlet, The Horned Lands, White Plume Mountain, Against the Giants, The Ghost Tower of Inverness, and possibly the most challenging dungeon in the NWN multiverse-- Undermountain, with more on the way. There are many quests, some of which place the world itself in jeopardy. It is low to mid-magic, with some minor environmental factors to consider.
			</p>
			<p>The World of Greyhawk can be a hostile environment, and it is not for the novice player. There are traps, puzzles, obstacles, in addition to rare and dangerous creatures. The not so rare & not so dangerous critters are also pretty dangerous here. :-)
			</p>
			<p>There are also multiple crafting options, character editors, and Bard Studios for bard characters to create their own lyrics or their songs. There are searchable libraries, intrigues, plots, villains, evil cults, and other things that go bump in the night. One can play from Level 1 to Level 40 on this server and then do it again with a different character and adventure in completely different areas unseen by the former character.
