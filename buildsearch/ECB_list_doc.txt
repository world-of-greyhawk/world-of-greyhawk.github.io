This is the documentation for the character build search list.

The build list was automatically generated, but can be edited by hand.
Colons separate fields, unless followed by a semicolon. (Yes, having the
escape character after the character it is escaping is rather non-standard.
Sorry. I had a reason for it at the time, and I have not seen sufficient
reason to justify a change. Extra spaces at the beginning and end of a
field will be ignored. Slashes are used to separate classes within a field.
The field order (with square brackets indicating optional parts) is

topic number: author: race: class1 level1[/ class2 level2[/ class3 level3]]: name

Races and classes should be in standard form (spelled correctly). In addition
to the standard races, the race field can be "any" to indicate a build that
works for all races, or "unknown" to specify that the race cannot be determined
from information in the forum. (A blank race is also treated as unknown, but
with the provision that my updater utility would try to determine the race again.)
Question marks at the end of a race name indicate a race that was deduced from
a rule that I lack full confidence in, so has a higher probability of error than
I would like.

Any items that lack an author will be treated as deleted (another artifact of
the now-defunct updater).
