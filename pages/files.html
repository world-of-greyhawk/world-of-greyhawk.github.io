	<h3>Required</h3>
	<p>The World of Greyhawk Server requires Neverwinter Nights 1.69 (or the Enhanced Edition&ndash;there are currently two servers running) including both the Shadows of the Undrentide and the Hordes of the Underdark expansions as well as the Community Expansion Project version 2.65. This allows for a wide variety of content and helps provide players with the best possible experience.
	</p>
	<p>To download the CEP, visit <a href="https://neverwintervault.org/cep" target="_blank">the Vault</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Optional</h3>
	<h4>Domain Override</h4>
	<p>This override adds three new domains that can be used on this server: Law, Chaos, and Luck. <a href="https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/hakpak/chaos-law-luck-domains-override" target="_blank">Download from the Vault</a> and add to your override folder.
	</p>

	<h4>Portraits</h4>
	<p>DM Raine collected a lot of portraits over time and posted the good ones to <a href="https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/images/portrait/wog-portrait-pack" target="_blank">the Vault</a>. Just download this collection into your portraits folder (to use them for your characters) or your override folder (to see others' portaits).
	</p>

	<h4>Goblin and Undead Override</h4>
	<p>DM Raine endorses these enhancments to creature appearances. Just download into your override folder: <a href="https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/prefab/creature/lord-worms-creature-pack" target="_blank">Lord of Worms - Creature Pack</a>
	</p>

	<h4>Amethyst Dragon's Transparent GUI Override</h4>
	<p>A popular change to the user interface: <a href="https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/gui/complete-gui-alterations-package-transparent-and-colorized" target="_blank">Complete GUI Alterations Package</a>
	</p>

	<h4>Others</h4>
	<p>It is highly recommended that players not use other overrides (other than GUI/Interface ones) as this can affect the overall performance of the server.
