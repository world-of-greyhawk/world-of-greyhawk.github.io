	<h3>Required</h3>
	<p>The World of Greyhawk Server requires Neverwinter Nights 1.69 including both the Shadows of the Undrentide and the Hordes of the Underdark expansions as well as the Community Expansion Project version 2.65.  This allows for a wide variety of content and helps provide players with the best possible experience.
	<p>To download the CEP, visit <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=96573&amp;id=7849" target=" _blank">the Vault</a>.

	<h3>Optional</h3>
	<h4>Portraits</h4>
	<p>DM Raine:  I've collected a lot over time and I've posted the ones that I thought were good. Just download this collection into your portraits folder under the NWN folder on your hard drive.  If you don't have a portraits folder, create one.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Portraits.Detail&amp;id=5759" target="_blank">Portraits Compilation</a>

	<h4>Goblin Override</h4>
	<p>DM Raine:  I like this goblin override. It just changes the appearance of goblins you run across. Just download into your override folder: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Creatures.Detail&amp;id=601" target="_blank">Goblin Enhancement Override</a>

	<h4>Undead Override</h4>
	<p>DM Raine:  I'm also enjoying an undead override, especially good for those who've played a lot and are tired of seeing the same undead. Again, just download into your override folder:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Creatures.Detail&amp;id=108290&amp;id=598">Undead Override</a>

	<h4>Amethyst Dragon's Transparent GUI Override</h4>
	<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140729152812/http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=46783&amp;id=1433">The Amethyst Dragon's Transparent GUI Override</a>

	<h4>Others</h4>
	<p>It is highly recommended that players not use other overrides (other than GUI/Interface ones) as this can affect the overall performance of the server.
