	<h2>Bestiary of Deadly and Perilous Creatures</h2>
	<p class="subheader">Compiled by Drake Phan-teth</p>

	<p>Rather than be a monster manual per se, I thought it would be a bit more interesting to share anecdotal observations of some of WoG's nasties. No hard stats or anything, like that, but just a piecemeal attempt to create a running journal of the many banes that haunt the daily lives of our characters.
	<br />Please see <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=90&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">this thread</a> on the forum for the original entries, their respective authors, and commentary.
	</p>

	<h3>Worg Riders</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>They have Evasion, so you 5th level mages looking to test out your new fireball, beware.
		<li>They have excellent Spot/Listen skills. One followed me and attacked me while I was Invisible via potion. Another spotted me while I was stealthed, not moving, in clothes with an 18 Dex and max stealth skills while not moving.
		<li>They can stealth and sneak attack.
		<li>They can spam knockdowns
		<li>Even after you kill one, you are still going to have to face either the rider or the Worg.
		<li>They are tenacious. They will follow you out of caves, across maps, through transition screens, and will even follow you all the way to Borderkeep.
		<li>They can take a hit. Criticals not withstanding, melee tyes better plan on hitting them at least 4 solid times before they go down.
		<li>Finally, there never is just one Worg Rider. They hunt in packs. If you see them, multiply the number you see by 3, and that's how many is really there. Often the case is you'll see one and think "Just one? I can take him. And in the next round you are suddenly surrounded by a pack. 
	</ol>
	<p>Worg Riders are nothing to be trifled with. If you ar below 6th level, you better pack a lunch.
	</p>

	<h3>Bugbear Heroes</h3>
	<p>One of the larger species of goblins. Typically found in the Dark Arrow Forest, the Goblin Caves, Undermountain, and wherever goblins and filth are found.
	</p>
	<p>Be leary, young adventurers, of these hulking goblinoids. These are no ordinary Bugbears. These brutes have some Stealth capability as well as some decent Spot skills. Young rogues take note: they can beat your stealth check and plant 20 pounds of steel in your skull faster than you can type "wtf!".
	</p>
	<p>While their hit points and AC are on the mediocre side, they're chief weapon lies in damage dealt. They have the ability to enter Rage, which is probably similar to a Barbarian's Rage feat, and thus you can expect increased AB and damage, and perhaps even an increased Will Save.
	</p>
	<p>Further, they two-fist Great Axes, and if they land a shot, you are going to feel it. If they land a critical, you can look forward to respawning. A typical critical by a Bugbear Hero is 40+ points. If you find yourself flanked by 2 Heroes, get out of there, fast. Never take on more than one at a time, unless you are a very seasoned adventurer. One well-aimed shot by these beasts will take a fully healthy 6th level character to Near Death. Needless to say that two criticals will pretty much ruin anybody's day. I've watched an 8th level Paladin in Full Plate and Tower Shield go from 80 hit points to -5 hit points in 1 round against two of these bruisers. He was quite shocked, as their CR did not seem commensurate to the instant smackdown they express-delivered to him.
	</p>
	<p>Spellcasters should also consider taking these fellows out first in combat. A Mage's bodies can't cash the checks that these Great Axes write, plus they will shred their Stoneskins in a matter of Rounds, if not flurries.
	</p>
	<p>Be wary, young adventurers, be very wary. Don't charge a room with these fellows in it. You may only see one, but I'd bet a portal scroll there's a second one stealthed and ready to rip you a new one. (Not to mention the 4 worg riders who were also stealthed-- see previous entry.)
	</p>

	<h3>Wendigo</h3>
	<p>This creature has its roots in Native American mythology, and was possibly used as a metaphor to keep tribes from resorting to cannibalism. The Wendigo started as human, but through the eating of human flesh became possessed by evil spirits and morphed into some kind of beast. Descriptions of the monster describe it as being a cross between a Sasquatch, a troll and an evil spirit. Exclusively found in cold climates, possibly related to the Yeti.
	</p>
	<p>Why this creature is found in the Public Crypts is a large unknown, but one should take care when confronting this beast. He is formidable in melee, but not too difficult. What makes the Wendigo special is his Howl of Death, which may or not be similar to a Wail of the Banshee. Regardless, its howl can cause instant death if you fail your Fort save. That in itself isn't so bad, but when you face him along with a Bodak, a Greater Mummy and a Warrior Mummy, you'll find yourself making quite a few saves, and sooner or later you'll fail one of them. The best defense against this creature is a Belt of Guiding Light, as this will negate his howl (and the Bodak's red rays of death). A simple silence spell might also shut the Wendigo up, and allow you to deal with him.
	</p>
	<p>I haven't determined if this creature is undead or not, but given his proximity to the other undead (including a Revenant), my guess is that he is and might also be succeptible to Turning.
	</p>
	<p>It is not known if this creature appears anywhere else in WoG, or if there are "Greater" variations.
	</p>

	<h3>Elf Mercenaries</h3>
	<p>This generic opponent seems hardly worth mentioning in a world populated by Beholders, Demiliches and Dragons. In fact, so inconspicuous is the Elf Merc is that you'll find him in a huddle of common Half-orc bandits, Dwarf mercs, Halfling mercs and Human Mercs, all who wil often be rated as Effortless. Depending on your level, the Elf Merc will be rated as Easy or Moderate--nothing to get worked up about.
	</p>
	<p>But let me warn you now, take this guy out first, and take him out fast. He can not only cast 9th level spells, he can cast a lot of them. In combat, he almost always gets Weird off, in addition to any other Death-like spells afforded to his caster level. He Timestops, goes into Greater Stoneskin and Trueseeing, and then any stealthed-based character can kiss their buttcheeks goodbye.
	</p>
	<p>Probably the best defense as a melee character is to hit him with a Knockdown in the first round. Don't allow him off his back. You don't want to have to make saves against this guy, for Murphy will make sure you fail them.
	</p>
	<p>Casters should target him first, or launch their big AoE spell in his vicinity.
	</p>
	<p>Rogues should sneak him before all others, but he has keen senses, so use caution. If he spots you first, run....run far away.
	</p>
	<p>These guys can be found in several areas, most notably UM and the Bandit Lands.
	</p>

	<h3>Adamantium Golems</h3>
	<p>Beware of these beasts. You find them only in UM but when you see them, you would do well to be afraid.
	</p>
	<p>They may be rated moderate to you but they are anything but moderate as you will soon find out if you let it close in on you.
	</p>
	<p>Not only do they have an AB of 49, no, they also do 50-60 damage per hit and laugh at your puny attempts to damage them with your best enchanted weapons or spells.
	</p>
	<p>However, they do have a weakness and that is their resistance to elemental damage that is non existant. If you can hit one often enough with elemental damage, you may get lucky spending only 2 healing potions. If not, say hi to your local priest.
	</p>

	<h3>Stingers</h3>
	<p>Found in the Bright Lands, this race of intelligent, vicious man-scorpions seems to be highly organized and skilled in the arts of war and magic.
	</p>
	<p>First, they're impossible to Stealth against. They have been able to spot me even through Improved Invisibility, and they must have some type of sense that can track and locate creatures through tremours and vibrations in the shifting sands and rock. Where this race has evolved from is anyone's guess, but I know of one person who might shed some light on that.
	</p>
	<p>Their frontliner warriors, the Stinger Champions, can hit like it's nobody's business, and I have seen their mighty swords cleave rock itself.
	</p>
	<p>My study of their Sorcerers has led me to believe that they draw their power from a source other than study and learning. They have mastered the spells of Mestil and Evard, and who taught them these dark arts is a mystery.
	</p>
	<p>Their Archers are practiced and seasoned, and I have never seen them miss with their first volley.
	</b>

	<h3>White Slaadi</h3>
	<p>Honestly, it's quite easy to figure it out; it's in the name see?
	</p>
	<p>What's so special about these guys?  Let's see:
	<ul>
		<li>Spam FoDs, Implosions, Hammers of the Gods and Words of Faiths
		<li>Have a good 40+ AC
		<li>Hit consistently at 40+ Damage, and oh yeah: HIT consistently. (40+AB)
		<li>DR vs. fire, acid, physical and possibly frost.
		<li>Have A LOT of HP; in fact 3 empowered Ikes Yikes didn't even make a dent on him.
	</ul>
	<p>Now let that sink in.
	</p>
	<p>And if all that isn't enough, they tend to travel in packs &amp; have an older, more powerful brother known as the Black Slaad.

	<h3>Rust Monsters</h3>
	<p>Name: Rust Monster
		<br/>Occupation: Bogeyman
		<br/>Stats: Not important
		<br/>Special: Eats metals. That include the sharp one you are wacking him with. Oh, that Chain mail+5 of yours is practically a feast for them.  Also, it seems like some of the rusties around these regions have gotten a bit more intelligent about sniffing out their meals.
	</p>
	<p>Have you ever met its bigger cousins? The Rust Golems? I don't know whether or not they have the same nasty abilities (I was so scared I lobbed my familiar at it and ran for it.)
	</p>
	<p>Run adventurer, run far, far away.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Swarms of Bugs</h3>
	<p>A cloud of flying, biting, noxious, disease carrying and energy sucking bugs.
	</p>
	<p>Habitat: Near deserts, swamps or anywhere with lots of exposed, dead bodies.
		<br/>Special: Abuse the system: because of lack of a target, it denies players(physical fighters) the ability to fight back.
		<br/>How to kill it: Chuck a fireball at one's own feet.  Or run until you find something else to fight, then take it with a Cleave, or as your next target.  Or use an area of effect spell/wand/scroll.  Projectiles such as acid bombs or fire bombs should work as well.
	</p>
	<p>Something else that might work: swap weapons or unequip whatever is in your off-hand. If the stop-swap script tries to trigger an attack of opportunity, the next thing it does is give you a combat lock on your current target. If your current target cannot be determined, the nearest living, visible, hostile creature is used (if one is in range).
	</p>

	<h3>Bone Medusas</h3>
	<p>An undead medusa, her petrifying gaze can stop the hardiest of the parties in their tracks.
	</p>
	<p>These creatures usually lurk in the depth of many a crypts and tombs, hiding behind waves of lesser undead and waiting for the perfect opportunity to unleash her deadly gaze upon the world.
	</p>

	<h3>Razor Boars</h3>
	<p>These particularly vicious ungulates are ordinarily found as part of a horde of the less dangerous Dire Boar. While their three foot long tusks are impressive, your average adventurer still may underestimate their ferocity. Possessing the uncanny ability to heal their wounds, even as they are inflicted, as well as seeming to 'shrug off' many of the blows they may receive, these critters can put up quite a fight. Many is the adventurer who has tried to take one on, only to find himself exhausted, while the beast doesn't seem to miss a beat. One is advised to avoid these creatures unless a way is found to deal with them quickly.
	</p>
	<p>These suckers have some serious regen, and DR to boot. I still haven't managed to defeat one. Luckily, they seem to get confused when they chase after you. Apparently they're just not that concerned that you've been hacking away at them with a large curved sword. I guess I wouldn't be either, if I were still "uninjured." Tough cookies.
