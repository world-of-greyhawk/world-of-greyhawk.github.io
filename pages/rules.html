	<h2>Server Rules</h2>
	<p>These rules may be changed at any time.</p>

	<h3>Character behavior (IC)</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Do not kill ANYTHING that isn't hostile to you. Do not cast harmful area effect spells near NPCs. Leave the merchants alone. This includes animals, clergy, cobblers, fishmongers, makers of fine meats, blacksmiths, jewelers, and panthers named Tiny.
		<li>Pickpocketing of NPCs is not allowed. Pickpocketing of PCs is allowed, but only in PvP areas.
		<li>Do not steal the loot from another player's kills.
		<li>Quests are not to be repeated by an individual/group.
		<li>Avoid obvious cheese tactics, such as attacking a large creature from a location where the monster cannot reach.
	</ol>
	<h3>Player behavior (OOC)</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>No player grieving.
		<li>No use of obscene language on the forum or the server.
		<li>Abuse of PvP (picking on lower level characters) or pickpocketing will be dealt with harshly.
		<li>No powerleveling. Parties are expected to contain players within 3 levels of each other until level 20, within 4 levels if in the 20-30th level range, and within 5 levels if 30+. Higher level characters should not reduce monsters to within a few hit points to allow a lower level character to kill it.
		<li>Let each player play as they wish when it comes to RP. RP is not mandatory, but ridiculing/harassing/annoying RP is forbidden.
		<li>Light gems are in the shops for the benefit of players. Players are not to buy the gems simply to add to an item and then sell the item for quick cash. Players will be punished for this. If the problem becomes chronic, the gems will be removed.
		<li>Selling items with continual flame for the sake of quick coin is also banned.
		<li>Character builds that require an alignment change are not allowed.
		<li>Items can be transferred to another character, but only to characters of another player, and only in exchange for <strong>at least</strong> their GP value. (Exceptions can be made for minor gifts, but keep them reasonable, such giving a potion to a fellow worshipper of your deity.)
		<li>Plot items are not to be given out to others. Characters cannot have mulitples of certain plot items, nor are these certain items to be sold.
	</ol>
	<h3>Keeping the server happy</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Do not avoid easy spawns. That is, if you spawn it and know you can kill it, you should do so. The server has sometimes been cluttered with monsters that were avoided by players who could easily defeat them because they are in a hurry to get somewhere. Such spawning can slow down the server. This problem has been partly remedied by a clean up script, but even so, with the large areas a lot of creatures could be spawned before you leave the area. There will not be any monster defeats by attrition for most areas. Monsters either rest or despawn after players leave in most areas.
		<li>Turning invisible and looting lairs without fighting is not permitted. This can lag the server. It's cheesy, and who wants to be the next player to run the gauntlet of clearing an area only to find the treasure already robbed? If it continues, you can expect for bosses to automatically have true seeing and/or impossible traps that cast invisibility purge, etc.
		<li>Certain areas are secret as are certain plots. Please let other players discover them on their own.
	</ol>
	<h3>Technical limitations</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Do not go AFK during a conversation with an NPC, especially a merchant. You prevent other players from talking to that NPC.
		<li>If you have two computers playing from one IP via router, make sure that you have different ports set for the computers.
	</ol>
	<h3>Guidance</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Do not expect the usual magical loot. The magic items on this server are plentiful, but less powerful than most servers.
		<li>Overall plot may be discovered once the players have earned the trust of the higher ups through level advancement.
		<li>Party play is recommended as the server is difficult.
		<li>The forest around Borderkeep are recommended for beginning players, as is the Village of Hommlet adventure and the Ruskis Pirate adventure. In most areas, particularly outdoors, spawns will adjust to your level.
		<li>Have fun! If you have a group that wishes to play, you can contact a DM and they will try to enhance any events you wish to schedule.
	</ol>
