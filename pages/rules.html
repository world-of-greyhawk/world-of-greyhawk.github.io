	<h2>Server Rules</h2>
	<ol>
		<!-- NOTE: Items that are commented out are kept to aid re-synching with the forum post.
		           They have been commented out because they are not so much "rules" as "changes". -->
		<li>Do not kill ANYTHING that isn't hostile to you. Do not cast harmful area effect spells near NPCs. Leave the merchants alone. This includes animals, clergy, cobblers, fishmongers, makers of fine meats, blacksmiths, jewelers, and panthers named Tiny.
		<li>Pickpocketing of NPCs is not allowed. Pickpocketing of PCs is allowed, but only in PvP areas.
		<!--li>Food is required for rest. Food will automatically be deducted upon rest.-->
		<!--li>Hardcore rules as to bleeding are in effect. A player does not die at 0 hit points, but is unconscious. That player will bleed 1 hp each round unless treated by someone with a healing kit, using the heal skill, or casting a healing spell. There is also a 10% chance per round of bleeding stopping on its own. The new healing kits do not restore hit points, but the OC healing kits, when found, will do so.-->
		<!--li>Spell and feat changes are noted in other threads.-->
		<li>No player grieving.
		<li>No use of obscene language on the forum or the server.
		<!--li>Oil can be used to create campfires or tossed onto enemies.-->
		<li>Abuse of PvP (picking on lower level characters) or pickpocketing will be dealt with harshly.
		<li>No powerleveling. Parties are expected to contain players within 3 levels of each other until level 20, within 4 levels if in the 20-30th level range, and within 5 levels if 30+. Higher level characters should not reduce monsters to within a few hit points to allow a lower level character to kill it.
		<!--li>Penalty for death is, for now, 50 xp per level and 10% gold.-->
		<li>Do not expect the usual magical loot. The magic items on this server are plentiful, but less powerful than most servers.
		<!--li>Healing potions, though labeled similarly, may have different levels associated with them. Healing potions do not automatically restore the maximum hit points per level imbued. Please check healing potions before buying them. Some healing potions are found under the merchant's miscellaneous tab. Those healing potions can be used on others who are bleeding.-->
		<li>Let each player play as they wish when it comes to RP. RP is not mandatory, but ridiculing/harassing/annoying RP is forbidden.
		<!--li>Guilds may be made in the future.-->
		<li>Overall plot may be discovered once the players have earned the trust of the higher ups through level advancement.
		<!--li>Bluff is not used often on this server. Persuade is used on rare occasion.-->
		<li>Party play is recommended as the server is difficult.
		<li>The forest around Borderkeep are recommended for beginning players, as is the Village of Hommlet adventure and the Ruskis Pirate adventure. In most areas, particularly outdoors, spawns will adjust to your level.
		<!--li>A newer version of lockpicks are available as well as the standard ones. The newer version still has some bugs and will be fixed eventually.-->
		<li>Do not go AFK during a conversation with an NPC, especially a merchant. You prevent other players from talking to that NPC.
		<li>Do not steal the loot from another player's kills.
		<li>Have fun! If you have a group that wishes to play, you can contact a DM and they will try to enhance any events you wish to schedule.
		<li>These rules may be changed at any time.
		<!--li>You need to have SoU, HotU, the 1.69 patch, and CEP 2.65 to play.-->
		<li>A technical rule - if you have two computers playing from one IP via router, make sure that you have different ports set for the computers.

		<!-- NOTE: The rest of this list comes from replies to the topic; they are not numbered in the forum -->
		<li>Quests are not to be repeated by an individual/group.
		<li>Players should not avoid easy spawns. That is, if you spawn it and know you can kill it, you should do so. The server has sometimes been cluttered with monsters that were avoided by players who could easily defeat them because they are in a hurry to get somewhere. Such spawning can slow down the server. This problem has been partly remedied by a clean up script, but even so, with the large areas a lot of creatures could be spawned before you leave the area. There will not be any monster defeats by attrition for most areas. Monsters either rest or despawn after players leave in most areas.
		<!--li>Bluff or intimidate may be used once or twice, but persuade is used more often and is a better choice. If bluff or intimidate are used, a persuade choice is also available. Vice versa is not necessarily true.-->
		<li>Light gems are in the shops for the benefit of players. Players are not to buy the gems simply to add to an item and then sell the item for quick cash. Players will be punished for this. If the problem becomes chronic, the gems will be removed.
		<li>Selling items with continual flame for the sake of quick coin is also banned.
		<li>Turning invisible and looting lairs without fighting is not permitted. This can lag the server. It's cheesy, and who wants to be the next player to run the gauntlet of clearing an area only to find the treasure already robbed? If it continues, you can expect for bosses to automatically have true seeing and/or impossible traps that cast invisibility purge, etc.
		<li>Character builds that require an alignment change are not allowed.
		<li>Items can be transferred to another character, but only to characters of another player, and only in exchange for <strong>at least</strong> their GP value. (Exceptions can be made for minor gifts, but keep them reasonable, such giving a potion to a fellow worshipper of your deity.)
		<li>Plot items are not to be given out to others. Characters cannot have mulitples of certain plot items, nor are these certain items to be sold.
		<li>Avoid obvious cheese tactics, such as attacking a large creature from a location where the monster cannot reach.
		<li>Certain areas are secret as are certain plots. Please let other players discover them on their own.
