	<h2>Item Changes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Oil can be used to create campfires or tossed onto enemies.
		<li>Healing potions, though labeled similarly, may have different levels associated with them. Healing potions do not automatically restore the maximum hit points per level imbued. Please check healing potions before buying them. Some healing potions are found under the merchant's miscellaneous tab. Those healing potions can be used on others who are bleeding.
		<li>A newer version of lockpicks are available as well as the standard ones. The newer version still has some bugs and will be fixed eventually.
		<li>Especially for those specializing in a particular type of weapon, magical items of the player's choice may be purchased from a DM in the game. This is limited to one purchase every five character levels, with more powerful items available at the higher levels (e.g. +1 at level 5, +2 at level 10, etc.). Purchases made at levels 30, 35, and 40 may have to be requested in the forum so that the items can be made in advance. (Most items allowed for the lower level purchases can be created on-the-fly by DMs.)

	<h2>Mechanics Changes</h2>
	<ul>
		<!-- NOTE: Items that are commented out are kept to aid re-synching with Raine's
		           reply to GhostNWN. They have been commented out because they are covered elsewhere. -->
		<li>Logoff/relogging does not get you your hp back.
		<!--li>Unless you see a situation you cannot win, KILL YOUR SPAWNS.-->
		<li>Rest is allowed every 8 hours. Food is required to rest (consumed automatically). You cannot rest while wearing heavy armor.
		<li>You can get food by skinning dead animals and cooking the meat on the campfire.
		<!--li>If you have multiple characters, keep them separate. I do not want you to hand off items from one characer to another.-->
		<!--li>Plot items are not to be given out to others.-->
		<!--li>Obvious cheese tactics will also be punished.-->

		<!-- NOTE: The rest of this list has been cobbled together from other sources. -->
		<li>Hardcore rules as to bleeding are in effect. A player does not die at 0 hit points, but is unconscious. That player will bleed 1 hp each round unless treated by someone with a healing kit, using the heal skill, or casting a healing spell. There is also a 10% chance per round of bleeding stopping on its own. The new healing kits do not restore hit points, but the OC healing kits, when found, will do so.
		<li>Penalty for death is, for now, 50 xp per level and 10% gold.
		<li>Bluff or intimidate may be used once or twice, but persuade is used more often (but still not often) and is a better choice. If bluff or intimidate are used, a persuade choice is also available. Vice versa is not necessarily true.
