	<h2>Feat Changes</h2>
	<h3>All Classes</h3>
	<h4>Mounted Combat</h4>
	<p>Rider gets a dodge AC bonus of +1 per 5 ranks in the ride skill while mounted. This does not stack with tumble (the tumble AC bonus is retained while mounted).
	</p>

	<h3>Casters</h3>
	<h4>Brew Potion</h4>
	<p>Scripted so that the level of the potion will better approximate the level of the maker.
	</p>
	<h4>Craft Wand</h4>
	<p>Scripted so that the level of the wand will better approximate the level of the maker. Crafted wands are always made with 50 charges.  Also a crafted wand can only be used by the class that crafted it.
	</p>
	<h4>Epic Spell: Dragon Knight</h4>
	<p>Dragon has been substantially beefed up.
	</p>
	<h4>Epic Spell: Greater Ruin</h4>
	<p>Damage is increased to 35d6 + 2d6/caster level over 20.
	</p>
	<h4>Epic Spell Hellball</h4>
	<p>Damage increased to 10d6 + d6/2 caster levels over 20 for each of the 4 categories of damage.
	</p>
	<h4>Epic Spell: Mummy Dust</h4>
	<p>Mummy has been substantially beefed up.
	</p>
	<h4>Expertise/Improved Expertise</h4>
	<p>Is not supposed to be available to casters while casting. Apparently a bug allows expertise mode to be used until after the first spell is cast.
	</p>
	<h4>Scribe Scroll</h4>
	<p>Scripted so that the level of the scroll will better approximate the level of the caster. A scribed scroll can only be used by the class that scribed it.
	</p>
	<h4>Summon Familiar</h4>
	<p>The death of a familiar will cost the caster 100 gold and 50 xp.
	</p>

	<h3>Barbarians</h3>
	<h4>Terrifying Rage:</h4>
	<p>Panic effect lasts 4d4 rounds, not 1d3. Gives +d20 to intimidate, not d10. Uses turned effect so creatures run away instead of standing there. Fear immunity prevents effect, not mindspell or paralyzation immunity.
	</p>

	<h3>Blackguards</h3>
	<h4>Epic Fiendish Servant</h4>
	<p>The Epic Vrock is more powerful than the default one.
	</p>
	<h4>Turn Undead</h4>
	<p>(See below)
	</p>

	<h3>Clerics, Blackguards, and Paladins</h3>
	<h4>Turn Undead</h4>
	<p>Evil clerics rebuke undead and even dominate if sufficient level. Certain domains and feats add to this ability. Having your holy symbol out in hand will also improve this ability.
	</p>

	<h3>Harpers</h3>
	<h4>Harper Crafting</h4>
	<p>A 5th level Harper, in addition to Bull's and Cat's Grace, can also create potions of Invisibility, Ultravision, Haste and Clairaudience/Clairvoyance.
	</p>

	<h3>Purple Dragon Knights</h3>
	<h4>Heroic Shield</h4>
	<p>Now lasts for PDK level + charisma modifier in rounds.
	</p>
	<h4>Rallying Cry</h4>
	<p>Now lasts for PDK level + charisma modifier in rounds.
	</p>

	<h3>Shadowdancers</h3>
	<h4>Epic Shadowlord</h4>
	<p>Summoned shadow has a changed appearance, the ability to cast improved invisibility three times and has attacks that can drain strength.
	</p>
	<h4>Hide in Plain Sight</h4>
	<p>Has a cool down period scripted so that you cannot HiPS twice within 6 seconds.
	</p>
	<h4>Shadow Evade</h4>
	<p>Duration changed from 5 rounds to 1 round + 1 round/level. As you get shadow evade at level 4, this will never shorten this ability for the player and promotes leveling in shadowdancer.
	</p>
