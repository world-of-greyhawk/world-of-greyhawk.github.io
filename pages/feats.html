	<h2>Feat Changes</h2>
	<h3>All Classes</h3>
	<h4>Expertise/Improved Expertise</h4>
	<p>Is supposed to be unavailable while casting a spell (from memory or an item). More accurately, it is turned off immediately after a spell is cast.
	</p>
	<h4>Mounted Combat</h4>
	<p>Rider gets a dodge AC bonus of +1 per 5 ranks in the ride skill while mounted. This does not stack with tumble (the tumble AC bonus is retained while mounted).
	</p>

	<h3>Casters</h3>
	<h4>Brew Potion, Craft Wand, Scribe Scroll</h4>
	<p>Scripted so that the item's caster level better approximates the level of the maker.
	While a brewed potion is usable by any class, a crafted wand or a scribed scroll can be used only by the class that created it.
	</p>
	<p>Crafted wands always have 50 charges upon creation.
	</p>
	<h4>Epic Spells</h4>
	<p>See the <a href="../index.html#spells" target="_parent">spell changes</a>. For the most part, these have been made more effective.
	</p>
	<h4>Summon Familiar</h4>
	<p>The death of a familiar will cost the caster 100 gold and 50 xp. Familiars cannot be healed by simple feeding.
	</p>

	<h3>Turners (Clerics, Blackguards, and Paladins)</h3>
	<h4>Turn Undead</h4>
	<p>Evil clerics rebuke undead and even dominate if sufficient level. Certain domains and feats add to this ability. Having your holy symbol out in hand will also improve this ability.
	</p>

	<h3>Naturalists (Druids and Rangers)</h3>
	<h4>Animal Companion</h4>
	<p>Companions cannot be healed by simple feeding.
	</p>

	<h3>Barbarians</h3>
	<h4>Terrifying Rage:</h4>
	<p>Panic effect lasts 4d4 rounds, not 1d3. Gives +d20 to intimidate, not d10. Uses turned effect so creatures run away instead of standing there. Fear immunity prevents effect, not mind spell or paralyzation immunity.
	</p>

	<h3>Blackguards</h3>
	<h4>Epic Fiendish Servant</h4>
	<p>The Epic Vrock is more powerful than the default one.
	</p>

	<h3>Champions of Torm</h3>
	<h4>Divine Wrath</h4>
	<p>Now lasts for a number of rounds equal to your charisma modifier, plus 1 round for every 5 Champion levels.
	</p>

	<h3>Harpers</h3>
	<h4>Harper Crafting</h4>
	<p>A 5th level Harper, in addition to Bull's Strength and Cat's Grace, can also create potions of Invisibility, Ultravision, Haste and Clairaudience/Clairvoyance.
	</p>

	<h3>Purple Dragon Knights</h3>
	<h4>Heroic Shield</h4>
	<p>Now lasts for PDK level + charisma modifier in rounds.
	</p>
	<h4>Rallying Cry</h4>
	<p>Now lasts for PDK level + charisma modifier in rounds.
	</p>

	<h3>Shadowdancers</h3>
	<h4>Epic Shadowlord</h4>
	<p>Summoned shadow has a changed appearance, the ability to cast improved invisibility three times and has attacks that can drain strength.
	</p>
	<h4>Hide in Plain Sight</h4>
	<p>Has a cool down period scripted so that you cannot HiPS twice within 6 seconds.
	</p>
	<h4>Shadow Evade</h4>
	<p>Duration changed from 5 rounds to 1 round + 1 round/level. As you get shadow evade at level 4, this will never shorten this ability for the player and promotes leveling in shadowdancer. The damage reduction caps at +6.
