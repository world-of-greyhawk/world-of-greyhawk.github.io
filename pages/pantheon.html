	<h2>Greyhawk Pantheon</h2>

	<h3>General</h3>
	<p>The pantheon and how follower/cleric/deity relations work in this realm are as close to 3rd Edition PnP D&amp;D as could be accomplished. Please adhere to these rules if you expect to be able to level up as a cleric or worship at a church.
	</p>
	<p>Some deities may have more than two domains. In most cases, you can pick any two from their list.
	</p>
	<p>Here are the rules you <strong>must</strong> follow to be a cleric:</p><ol>
		<li>You must set your deity. If you did not do this during character creation, visit the Altar of Worship in the server entrance.
		<li>You must spell the deity as it is shown. In most cases, a first or last name will suffice.
		<li>You must choose from the specified domains.
		<li>You must adhere to the race and alignment restrictions.
	</ol>
	<p>The pantheon listed below is incorporated into the game. You should chose from one of these gods if you choose a god. You may choose not to have a god; however, this may affect game play, and you will not be able to advance as a cleric on Oerth.
	</p>
	<p>We created a <a href="../deity/search.html" target="_parent">Deity Search App</a> to simplify the process of finding a deity appropriate to the character based on race, alignment, and domains for clerics.
